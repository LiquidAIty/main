# Changelog

All notable changes to Engraphis are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions use SemVer.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- The optional `hosted-eval` extra adds guarded hosted-Luna productivity evaluation with a
  redacted public evidence exporter.
- Protected public benchmark workflows now support redacted hosted and retrieval evidence runs.

### Security

- Untrusted ingress now fails closed: provenance and extractor metadata are allowlisted, suspicious
  records are quarantined before embedding, linking, graph extraction, resolution, recall, or
  grounding, and `scripts/rescan_poisoning.py` can retroactively label or quarantine old records.
- Trust is preserved across resolution, structured graph writes, consolidation, entity profiles,
  and review paths. Untrusted records cannot mutate or promote trusted memory, and derived outputs
  remain trusted only when every source is explicitly trusted.

### Documentation

- README and release guidance now match the current install extras, public entry points, product
  boundaries, and focused MCP/provider documentation.

### Fixed

- Public server entry points now share the v2 service, keeping recall behavior consistent across
  the dashboard, server, Compose, Classic, and MCP-over-HTTP.
- Keyed mutable-fact replacements now load their live predecessor directly, so reworded updates
  preserve history without relying on vector top-K recall.
- Versioned deterministic embeddings now rebuild persisted vectors after a mapping change, keeping
  existing databases searchable after an upgrade.
- Prompt-facing recall now widens candidate search when untrusted results crowd out trusted
  evidence, while keeping expansion bounded. Title text now contributes to absolute support floors
  for grounded and hosted recall.
- Hosted productivity evaluation now scores canonical, acceptable, or supporting-evidence answers
  with strict natural-language framing instead of token containment or raw JSON text.
- Hosted-Luna workers on Windows now establish kill-on-close containment before sending input; a
  failure refuses the request, and timeouts clean up the full worker tree.
- Poisoning rescans preserve existing temporal validity boundaries and invalidate affected edges
  without overwriting governed history.

### Changed

- CI and release/install metadata now cover Python 3.13 and 3.14.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `engraphis_context_savings` aggregates validated, content-free recall receipts by workspace,
  repo, operation, and token-counter identity. The view is available through the service,
  dashboard, and read-only APIs.
- Recall supports an explicit adaptive candidate-depth experiment while retaining the historical
  fixed depth by default. Performance reports record requested and actual candidate depths.
- `MemoryEngine` and `MemoryService` now provide adaptive context routing: bypass retrieval when
  prompt history fits, use compact recall when support is strong, and fall back to bounded recent
  history when support is weak.
- `eval.productivity` measures task completion, corrections, agent turns, memory calls, latency,
  and model-facing tokens.
- Chunk ingestion can enforce budgets with a configured Hugging Face tokenizer and records the
  counter identity, target, and overlap in chunk metadata.
- Offline adapters now cover MemoryAgentBench, LoCoMo-Plus, and Mem2ActBench, with a paired
  full-history versus Engraphis code-agent analyzer.
- Public benchmark evidence can carry source hashes, repository state, environment and model
  provenance, secret-redacted commands and URLs, content digests, and adjacent immutable SHA-256
  files.

### Changed

- Context-economy evaluation now compares full history, a same-budget recency window, and hybrid
  recall while accounting for indexing cost.
- Official LongMemEval-V2 output has a dedicated redacted evidence exporter that retains the
  official QA, token, and latency measures without publishing prompts, answers, model output, or
  retrieved context.
- Folder-sync dry runs no longer create a remote directory or persist a local device identity.

### Fixed

- Sync rejects malformed scope/repo combinations and every peer-driven visibility change for an
  existing memory, including malformed legacy rows. Scope promotion or repair remains a local,
  explicit governance operation.
- Workspace consolidation excludes session-private memories and partitions digests and entity
  profiles by their exact visibility owner, preventing cross-repo or cross-scope summaries.
- Tokenizer-aware chunk overlap can no longer exceed the configured prose budget or emit a
  duplicate overlap-only record before an oversized paragraph. Invalid token counters fail
  closed instead of silently producing mis-sized chunks.
- Ledger graph interactions preserve manually selected nodes during refreshes.
- The new evidence guide is included in wheel and source distributions.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Cloud Sync now continues past legacy plaintext, malformed, and tampered relay objects while
  still failing closed for each object. Later authenticated peer bundles apply, and the affected
  sync round is explicitly reported as incomplete rather than successful.
- Security and sync documentation now consistently distinguish end-to-end encrypted Cloud Sync
  from the separately readable managed-compute snapshot service.
- README visual PNG exports now use their SVG canvas dimensions without hidden screenshot padding.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Security

- Cloud Sync now encrypts every eligible shared-workspace bundle on the client with
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 before upload. The relay receives opaque deterministic bundle names and
  ciphertext only; tampered, renamed, cross-workspace, wrong-key, and legacy plaintext bundles
  are rejected before the merge engine.
- Cloud Sync requires a client-held 32-byte workspace key and the `cloud-sync` optional runtime.
  Missing or malformed encryption configuration stops sync rather than falling back to plaintext.

### Changed

- Cloud Sync privacy copy now states that eligible shared-workspace changes are encrypted
  end-to-end before leaving the device and cannot be read by Engraphis Cloud. Product and
  security documentation separately identifies managed compute as the readable, bounded-snapshot
  service it is.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- `engraphis_recall_context` brings the MCP surface to 30 tools and is the compact, hard-budget
  path for agent prompts. It returns packed context, compact source identities, strict token usage
  fields, optional retrieval diagnostics, and preserves `engraphis_recall` as the full-response
  compatibility surface.
- Recall and grounded recall now expose `valid_at` (world time) and `known_at` (system time);
  `as_of` remains the compatible `valid_at` alias and conflicting anchors are rejected. Retrieval
  defaults to the `balanced` profile; `auto` remains explicit opt-in.
- MCP and HTTP remember calls can set a fact's world-time `valid_from`; recall, grounded recall,
  and the compatibility answer tool can run a point-in-time `as_of` query.
- `eval.performance` reports full recall-pipeline quality, packed context tokens, and
  p50/p95/p99 latency with a reproducible JSON schema and deterministic corpus scaling.
- Schema v5 adds temporal history for symbols, code edges, code-memory links, and persisted
  memory-entity incidence. Code retrieval is now a first-class profile, and graph walks use
  bounded sparse PageRank instead of a dense quadratic transition matrix.
- Optional `subject_key` and `claim_kind` make mutable claims explicit. Uncertain similar facts
  are conservatively related while keyed or strongly evidenced contradictions supersede.
- `engraphis-benchmark/v2`, canonical workspace exports, and release-evidence manifests provide
  deterministic hashes, per-question records, fixed token-budget curves, and validation before
  public evidence is written.

### Fixed

- Supersessions now close the old fact at the replacement's effective world time instead of its
  ingestion time. Superseded, corrected, promoted, merged, forgotten, and consolidated source
  vectors remain available to historical semantic recall while temporal filters keep them out of
  the current view.
- Non-finite write and recall timestamps fail validation instead of entering scoring or SQLite.
- Ordinary recall is observational by default, so weak nearest-neighbor results do not gain
  stability merely by being returned. Grounded recall still reinforces only cited evidence, and
  Python callers with an explicit use signal can request reinforcement.
- Code and PPR retrieval now restrict incident-symbol and memory-entity lookups to the reachable
  frontier before applying their safety caps, and repo writes link text mentions to visible
  workspace-level entities.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Simplified the Ledger and Classic graph controls by removing the complete-graph action.
- Replaced the README Knowledge Graph image with the corrected Ledger screenshot.

### Fixed

- Ledger now has one working `Show unlinked nodes` control that reloads the intended bounded
  graph view.
- Time-travel graph views prioritize support visible at the selected anchor, and graph drag
  handling remains safe when browser animation-frame globals are unavailable.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **The complete Ledger design is now the primary local WebUI**, ported from the final
  five-area design package without its sample store or unsafe design runtime. Today, grounded
  Ask, Library, the advanced Graph & Relations view, Provenance, and Manage all use live v2 data.
  Manage includes workspaces, reviewed local consolidation, hosted Analytics/Automation/Team
  status, the full plan comparison, settings, and persisted Slate, Midnight, Paper, and Matrix
  themes.
- Ledger now exposes the production grounded-answer route (`POST /api/answer`), returning a
  cited answer or an explicit abstention. Graph & Relations ships the supplied graph capabilities:
  five layouts, four render styles, palettes, degree/betweenness sizing, bridge detection,
  valid-time filtering, superseded ghosts, focus, and automatic cluster collapse.
- The complete former dashboard remains available at `/classic`. Both interfaces expose a
  visible dashboard selector and share the same workspaces, memories, receipts, and engine.

### Changed

- Ledger defers both the CSP-sensitive renderer and graph payload until Graph & Relations is opened,
  ignores stale workspace responses, renders memory text through DOM text nodes, and provides
  responsive, reduced-motion-aware keyboard focus styling. Classic loads its lazy graph vendor
  dependency from its own packaged backup tree.
- Graph nodes now use oversampled, cached screen-space material rendering with face-level
  texture: full-face iridescent PVD for Cyber, directional blue-violet anodizing for Galaxy,
  concentric brushed copper for Solar, and horizontal satin gunmetal grain for Classic, with
  deterministic low-detail fallbacks for large graphs.
- Dashboard asset URLs now carry the node-material revision and local static responses
  revalidate, preventing an already-open browser from pinning the pre-material renderer.
- Pro and Team purchase actions now preserve both the selected plan and billing interval, while
  existing or lapsed subscribers are sent to the plan-neutral account portal for billing recovery.
  Public documentation now distinguishes hosted-account grace and recovery behavior from the
  always-local, Apache-licensed dashboard and MCP write paths.

### Fixed

- Token-protected dashboards can now establish a short-lived signed, HttpOnly browser session
  without storing the API token in browser storage. Remote peers remain denied when no token is
  configured, and non-loopback v1 server startup is refused unless authentication is enabled.
- Hosted entitlement refreshes use bounded exponential backoff, terminal denials settle every
  local entitlement view, inactive sessions expose no paid feature flags, and ambiguous
  single-use refresh responses permanently retire the possibly spent credential instead of
  replaying it.
- Recommended Automation bootstrap is resumable across partial upload/policy-save failures and
  authorizes paid work before generating or locking a local snapshot.
- Release checks now enforce commercial prices and trial terms, expose skipped tests instead of
  hiding them behind duplicate quiet flags, and verify the full-stack dependency imports used by
  the HTTP authorization boundary.

### Security

- Credential state directories are owner-only, product token forms are redacted consistently
  from logs, checkout overrides fail closed to validated HTTPS or loopback HTTP destinations, and
  unsafe control characters can no longer reform blocked browser URL schemes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

Public 1.1.0 hosted-connect and graph-experience release.

### Added

- **`engraphis connect --token engr_ct_…`**: the missing client half of device connect.
  `cloud_session.save_bootstrap()` is the only writer of `~/.engraphis/cloud_session.json`,
  and it had no production caller: the docs told paying customers to prefer a file nothing
  created, so a purchased installation could not be connected without hand-writing state.
  The new command redeems the one-time connect token from the account portal against
  `POST /v1/devices/connect`, saves the returned session with owner-only permissions, and
  verifies `cloud_session.configured()` before reporting success. The token is sent in the
  request body and nowhere else; it is never printed, logged, or written to disk, and every
  refusal maps to fixed, actionable copy (an expired or already-used token is not confused
  with a lapsed subscription). Session storage is pre-flighted before the exchange, so an
  unwritable state directory or a `cloud_session.json` replaced by a link fails the command
  *without* spending the single-use token; the customer fixes the path and retries with the
  same token instead of returning to the portal for a new one. Faults that can only happen
  *after* the exchange: a reply truncated mid-body (`http.client.IncompleteRead`), or an
  endpoint that stops resolving before the session is written (`CloudUrlUnresolved`) are
  reported as errors that say the token was already used, rather than escaping as tracebacks
  that leave the customer unable to tell whether to retry. Also installed as
  `engraphis-connect`.
- An `engraphis` front-door command that dispatches to the existing `engraphis-<verb>`
  entry points, so the command the account portal displays is runnable as shown.
- A stable per-installation identity at `~/.engraphis/client_identity.json` (random ULIDs,
  not a hardware fingerprint) so reconnecting a machine updates its existing installation
  instead of registering a new device every time.

### Removed

- Removed an unimplemented hosted export claim from public product surfaces.

### Changed

- Managed compute consent now travels with the cloud account: an installation connected to
  Engraphis Cloud is enabled for managed analytics, dreaming, and consolidation **by
  default**, because connecting already accepts the terms that cover it. A local-only
  installation with no cloud session is still never allowed.
  `ENGRAPHIS_MANAGED_COMPUTE_CONSENT` remains as an explicit operator override (`=0` opts a
  connected installation back out, `=1` forces it on regardless of session state) and is no
  longer surfaced anywhere in the UI.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-24

Public 1.0.1 client reliability release.

### Fixed

- Cloud Sync now defaults to `https://relay.engraphis.com` and safely migrates the former
  dashboard host and retired Railway relay URL without changing customer-provided relay URLs.
- Default Pro and Team upgrade links now target the live authenticated account portal rather
  than the retired Team dashboard host.
- Hosted endpoint validation now fails closed unless DNS establishes a globally routable
  destination, and credential-bearing HTTPS connections pin the vetted address while preserving
  original-host TLS verification to prevent DNS-rebinding SSRF.
- Hosted Automation and maintenance requests now use the selected workspace end to end rather
  than silently falling back to the first workspace.
- The Automation tab has one proposal action, clear managed-upload disclosure, and explicit
  managed-compute consent in addition to entitlement checks, snapshot redaction, and limits.
- Commercial metadata now describes Pro as one owner account across that owner's local
  installations, matching the hosted entitlement model; Team remains billed per named seat.
- API error responses and provider logs no longer expose arbitrary exception or configuration
  text; local folder and repository reads resolve and re-check filesystem boundaries.
- Entity extraction and dashboard asset migration avoid adversarial regular-expression
  backtracking. CodeQL now disables pull-request diff-informed analysis and CI fails on every
  raw SARIF result, including pre-existing and source-suppressed results.
- The documented grounded-recall evaluation prints with the default Windows console encoding.
- Hosted Pro and Team links preserve the selected plan through account creation and Checkout.
- A total `401`/`402`/`403` Cloud Sync authorization loss restores the hosted recovery CTA,
  while a successful empty or read-only workspace remains a partial result instead of being
  misreported as a total denial.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-23

Public 1.0.0 open-core GA release.

### Added

- The search-first Galaxy Knowledge Graph explorer with deterministic communities, canonical
  evidence-weighted scenes, entity/relation search, temporal filtering, evidence and history
  inspection, strongest-evidence paths, synchronized accessible tables, saved scene state,
  local PNG/JSON/CSV export, Simple and Advanced views, and a locally bundled ForceGraph + D3 renderer
  under the strict same-origin CSP.
- Additive schema-v4 canonical identity and bi-temporal edge-support records; deterministic
  graph scene, suggestion, entity, and path APIs; and a persisted graph-index job with dry-run,
  progress, cancellation, bounded errors, audit records, and tamper-evident receipts.
- A 29-tool MCP surface with explicit behavior annotations, operation receipts, exact session
  retry semantics, portable plugin manifests, and checksummed skill assets.
- Customer-side hosted protocols for scoped Cloud Sync, rotating cloud sessions, Analytics,
  and managed Automation requests, plus explicit manual folder exchange for local workflows.

### Changed

- The public distribution is a universal Python open-core package that runs only as a customer
  node. Hosted authorization, billing, relay storage, managed compute, Team identity, workers,
  and vendor operations remain private services.
- Commercial compatibility modules now expose presentation and customer-protocol metadata only;
  no environment variable turns the public package into a hosted Engraphis service.
- Session identity is exact across workspace, repo, authenticated user, agent, and goal; callers
  can request a distinct run with `force_new=true` and observe retry reuse explicitly.
- The legacy graph view defaults to deterministic community islands, keeps sparse influence
  bridges subordinate, and renders bounded A-MEM links when entity extraction is disabled. The
  repository screen demo proves session handoff, bi-temporal supersession, recall evidence, and
  history without an external service.
- The hosted no-card trial is exactly 3 active days after email confirmation. A separate
  `workspace_write_grace` may preserve ordinary local writes for at most 24 hours but never
  extends trial or paid cloud access.
- Apache-2.0 rights in published releases remain irrevocable; proprietary hosted value is
  enforced by the private implementation and service authorization boundary.

### Fixed

- Session start/end and session-scoped writes are atomic under concurrency; exact retries reuse
  one session while intentionally separate runs remain distinct.
- Rotating refresh credentials serialize across threads and processes, persist replacements in
  owner-only state, close failed HTTP responses, and never regress to a stale bootstrap value.
- Managed snapshots reserve a monotonic generation in the same local write transaction as the
  capture, use one operation ID per run and retry, redact provider errors, reject unknown
  sensitivity, exclude session and secret data, and enforce exact record/byte limits.
- Graph reads, suggestions, evidence, history, indexing, exports, audit views, fallback search,
  and workspace statistics consistently enforce workspace and session boundaries, including
  forgotten session-only graph evidence.
- Windows private-state validation uses safe file metadata checks without weakening symlink,
  ownership, size, or atomic-publication protections.
- Recall graph seeding uses one boundary-aware compiled pattern instead of rescanning every
  memory per entity, and the streamable HTTP launcher warms the singleton service before
  accepting clients.
- Graph GET requests remain read-only and return a rebuilding conflict while an explicit
  mutating index job is in progress.

### Security

- Bare memory IDs, shared-workspace controls, graph entities, statistics, snapshots, exports,
  audit rows, and keyword fallbacks cannot cross authenticated session or workspace boundaries.
- Managed uploads require explicit customer consent, are capped at 16 MiB and 100,000 rows,
  omit all session-scoped and secret-class memories, and surface only fixed client-safe
  provider errors.
- Customer credentials remain owner-only, redirect-safe, serialized during rotation, and are
  never substituted with an unproven local machine identifier.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-07-18

Security and reliability release spanning graph isolation and performance, Team / Pro
authentication, licensing and relay behavior, and the redesigned Knowledge Graph.

### Security

- Code-graph search, path, impact, export, and unified-graph reads now apply the same
  workspace/repo/session hierarchy filter as recall. Session-scoped memory content and
  identifiers previously remained reachable through persisted code-memory links from a
  repo-level caller. Reindexing still rebuilds those links for the owning session, but
  every read now filters them by caller-visible scope.
- Auth-bound dashboard users can no longer omit `workspace` to reach global recall.
  Inspector per-user and deployment bearer tokens now bind real or synthetic identities
  before personal receipt reads, so the deployment service account remains available for
  shared automation without bypassing personal-folder ownership. The standalone
  read-only graph endpoint also disables lazy write-on-read backfill.
- Repository indexing now creates a first-time Team workspace through the same
  privacy-aware path as remember/import/session writes, instead of silently creating a
  shared, unowned folder for the authenticated user.

### Fixed

- Code-graph layer responses and filters now use the concrete persisted layer, including
  inferred causal relations and explicitly semantic code edges. Code-memory link rebuilds
  page through every live repo-associated memory instead of clearing the bridge and
  stopping at 5,000, and Git impact parsing uses NUL-delimited paths without rewriting
  valid filename characters.
- Graph layer predicates are applied before workspace and code-edge response caps, and an
  explicit all-off layer selection remains empty instead of reverting to every layer.
  Layout preset and custom link-distance changes also recompute component centers while
  preserving the existing graph data and node objects.
  Filter reloads also tolerate transient graph-data invalidation, so restoring layers
  redraws the canvas instead of leaving the explorer list beside an empty graph.
- Oversized audio/video resources are rejected before transcription begins. A blank
  `ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_TOKEN` now correctly falls back to `ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN`.
- The sync relay now has its own per-IP token bucket
  (`ENGRAPHIS_RELAY_RATE_PER_MINUTE`, default 600) instead of sharing the
  60-request/minute license-registration budget. A full 64-bundle sync round can complete
  without throttling its final requests, while invalid-key floods remain bounded before
  Ed25519 verification.
- Every `/start-trial/verify` response (success, each error, and the 429) sends
  `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`. The request URL carries
  the one-time token, so the error pages are as Referer-leaky as the success page that
  holds the key; they previously used separate inline header literals and had drifted.

### Changed

- `GET /api/auth/users` checks `admin` at the route, matching `auth.min_role()`. The
  middleware already enforced admin, so this is defense in depth with no behaviour change;
  the route previously said `member`, which was dead code that misrepresented the policy.
- Successful version-tag publication now creates the matching GitHub Release and attaches
  the same validated wheel and source distribution sent to PyPI. Manual workflow dispatch
  remains build/check-only, and the release job is tag-gated behind successful PyPI
  publication.
- The Knowledge Graph defaults to compact component-aware packing and adds community,
  radial, constellation, original, and custom layouts; selectable Cyberpunk, Galaxy,
  Solar system, and Classic visual styles with persisted palettes; per-type node colors;
  a synchronized keyboard-accessible explorer; collision-aware labels; and responsive
  controls. Large graphs reuse rendered data, cap explorer DOM rows, reduce animation
  work, and suppress expensive dense-graph effects.
- The duplicate global Recall shortcut was removed from the dashboard header. Recall
  remains available in the Memory Operations sidebar and from contextual page actions.
- The README documentation was expanded to clarify note-link graphs, agent memory, code
  awareness, encryption, and sleep-time consolidation without making unmeasured product
  comparisons.
- The README now documents Command Code CLI as an MCP-native client and includes its
  verified stdio registration command.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-07-18

Hardening release focused on dependable installation, upgrades, startup, dashboard use,
and safe hosted deployment.

### Security

- Every entrypoint sends baseline response headers: CSP, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and HSTS over HTTPS
  only. Override with `ENGRAPHIS_CSP` / `ENGRAPHIS_HSTS`; set either to an empty string to
  omit that header where a fronting proxy supplies its own.
- Loopback/bootstrap trust now rejects all common forwarding metadata, including
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`; a same-host TLS proxy can no longer make an internet request
  look like an unproxied local setup request.
- Inspector first-admin setup now uses the auth store's atomic empty-database gate, so
  concurrent different-email requests cannot both create administrators.

### Added

- MCP clients now receive canonical recall, session, durable-memory, and handoff guidance
  through the server's initialization instructions.
- The dashboard exposes a small `/api` service index, and the graph CLI documents its
  public commands without showing the internal merge-driver command.
- Regression coverage now exercises the sqlite-vec backend, workspace-aware entity recall,
  installed database migration, encryption packaging, CLI startup, update paths, and release
  artifacts.

### Changed

- Installed builds now keep the default database in the platform user-data directory.
  Existing package-directory databases are copied with SQLite's backup API, validated, and
  preserved as recovery copies; source checkouts retain their repository-local default.
- `engraphis-update` discovers the highest stable SemVer tag, validates explicit versions,
  fails closed on fetch errors, refuses dirty editable worktrees, and keeps pip, pipx, Git,
  and documents the source-rebuild path for locally built Docker images.
- Dashboard styling and navigation were reworked with five selectable themes, responsive
  mobile behavior, semantic landmarks, improved keyboard focus, clearer confirmations, and
  fully self-hosted browser assets.
- Console launchers now validate arguments before optional imports, report actionable startup
  failures, display reachable IPv4/IPv6 URLs and resolved database paths, and advertise the
  current dashboard and API routes.
- Optional-dependency bounds and extras were refreshed. The cross-platform `all` extra no
  longer pulls the platform-limited SQLCipher driver, while encryption continues to fail
  closed when no compatible driver is available.
- The release workflow now pins actions by commit, runs the full test/evaluation and package
  validation gates, matches release tags to package versions, and reserves publishing for
  validated tag pushes. Bundled browser-library license notices are included in distributions.
- Installation, hosting, sync, graph-query, MCP tool-count, and database-location guidance was
  synchronized with the current commands and runtime behavior.

### Fixed

- Installed `engraphis-init` configuration is now loaded from the current directory's
  `.env` without parent traversal, while explicit environment variables retain precedence.
  Upgrading no longer opens a fresh platform-default database instead of the database the
  user selected through `engraphis-init`.
- A failed dashboard memory-detail request can no longer retain a prior memory identity or
  leave write controls enabled, preventing a later Save from modifying the wrong memory.
- A fresh hosted deployment now renders an actionable, non-data bootstrap screen when remote
  API access is denied by default; it offers the safe Team-trial path or deployment-variable
  setup without exposing account-wide license activation to a signed-out browser.
- Dashboard, REST, Inspector, MCP, licensing, sync, billing, and provider failures now return
  bounded user-facing messages rather than raw exceptions or upstream response bodies.
- Trusted-proxy handling now evaluates the rightmost forwarded hop, supports exact/CIDR
  allow-lists, and prevents untrusted forwarding headers from changing URLs or secure-cookie
  decisions. Interactive API documentation is disabled on user-facing servers by default.
- Dashboard handlers now read memory, workspace, member, and token identifiers from escaped
  `data-*` attributes instead of interpolating untrusted values into inline JavaScript.
- Repository-graph JSON output now escapes non-ASCII labels so Windows console encodings do
  not turn successful `impact`, `prs`, or query commands into exit-code 2 failures.
- A server-only installation now includes the multipart parser required by dashboard import
  routes instead of depending on the unrelated MCP extra to provide it transitively.
- `engraphis-mcp --help` works without importing the optional MCP stack; server-only and
  explicitly offline configurations no longer emit misleading missing-dependency warnings.
- Dashboard and legacy-server launch failures retain database recovery details instead of
  collapsing them into generic errors, and invalid port values are rejected cleanly.
- SQLite vector selection is now tested in both accelerated and offline-fallback modes, while
  memory writes remain durable and audited if an index update fails.
- The zero-configuration Compose dashboard now admits its Docker host bridge while both
  published ports remain loopback-only; widening a port requires an API token.
- Git-installed updates retain their recorded PEP 610 remote, and failed editable updates
  restore the original branch without exposing a Python traceback.
- Customer-operated sync relays are separated from the managed license/trial/invite service,
  and the sample `.env` no longer overrides installed database defaults with a relative path.
- MCP end-of-session guidance again represents completed work with an empty unresolved list
  instead of persisting a fake open thread.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-07-17

### Security
- Team-mode login gained a per-source-IP failure throttle (25 failures / 15 min)
  alongside the existing per-email lockout, closing the credential-stuffing sweep
  that tried each address once; lockouts now surface as a typed
  `AccountLockedError` mapped to HTTP 429 + `Retry-After` (previously 401, or a
  429 derived by substring-matching the error message).

### Fixed
- `remember`/`remember_with_resolution` are now atomic across the neighbor-resolve →
  insert sequence (engine-level write lock): concurrent near-duplicate writes can no
  longer both resolve ADD and store duplicates instead of NOOP/INVALIDATE.
- The Inspector's `/api/auth/login`/`setup` no longer run PBKDF2 (600k iterations)
  on the asyncio event loop; password hashing moved to a worker thread, so a burst
  of logins can't stall every other request.
- A failed vector-index upsert on the write path is now logged and audited
  (`index_upsert_failed`) instead of silently swallowed. Previously, the memory
  stayed invisible to semantic recall with no trace.
- URLs built from a bind host are now IPv6-safe and connectable (`engraphis.netutil`):
  `ENGRAPHIS_HOST=::` no longer yields the malformed `http://:::8700` in the printed
  dashboard URL, the :8710 redirector target, or `Settings.base_url`; wildcard binds
  map to loopback.
- The Docker image no longer bakes an IPv4-only bind: the entrypoint defaults
  `ENGRAPHIS_HOST` to dual-stack `::` when the kernel has IPv6 (what Railway's
  private-network healthchecks require) and `0.0.0.0` otherwise, so wiping the
  service's env vars can't regress the 2026-07-16 healthcheck outage.

### Changed
- Consolidated four per-app bearer-token checks into one constant-time
  `inspector.auth.bearer_ok` helper (scheme now matched case-insensitively per
  RFC 7235 everywhere); extracted the ~230-line code-graph HTML/Markdown export
  templates from `core/engine.py` into `core/codegraph_export.py`; documented the
  v1/v2 split in `engraphis/routes/__init__`; entity ancestor-widening in graph
  recall now applies to `workspace_id` symmetrically with `repo_id`; filtered
  sqlite-vec searches cap their geometric widening with a single full scan.

### Added
- Schema v3 logical graph layers (`temporal`, `entity`, `causal`, `semantic`), privacy-safe
  SHA-256 receipt chains, optional LLM/host retention supervision, and a persistent code↔memory
  bridge.
- Incremental multi-language repository indexing (Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C/C++,
  SQL, Terraform), docstrings/comments, variables, inheritance/implementation, weighted
  communities, hotspots, path queries, git/PR impact analysis, portable JSON/HTML/Markdown
  exports, and a graph union merge driver.
- Local multi-format resource ingestion for text/code/HTML/DOCX, optional PDF/image OCR and
  faster-whisper transcription, plus live PostgreSQL schema introspection with DSN redaction.
- Seven MCP tools for code paths/impact/export, PostgreSQL schema ingestion, and receipt
  list/verify/export, bringing the tool surface from 20 to 27.
- `engraphis-graph` workflow CLI and token-protected `engraphis-graph-server` read-only HTTP
  surface.

### Changed
- Railway hosting now supports Pro solo single-admin deployments: any active Pro or Team
  entitlement can bootstrap the first admin and activates the login wall, while member
  seats and direct hosted agent writes remain Team-only. The hosting guide now covers both
  Pro solo sync-relay and Team member flows.

### Fixed
- 1-hop graph recall (and the PPR large-graph fallback) now honors `graph_layers`, matching
  the PPR arm: `Store.neighbors()` gained a `layers` filter.
- `FolderTransport.push()` no longer follows peer-planted symlinks in the shared sync folder
  (unpredictable temp name + `O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`), closing an arbitrary-file-write
  vector that mirrored the already-hardened read side.
- `engraphis-graph-server` treats an empty `--host`/`ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_HOST` as non-loopback
  (it binds all interfaces), so the bearer-token requirement can no longer be skipped.
- Caller-supplied `metadata.retention_supervision` is stripped at the service boundary; only
  the validated `retention_class` presets can influence importance/stability.
- `merge_workspaces()` no longer duplicates symbols/code edges when both workspaces indexed
  the same file in a same-named repo: the losing snapshot's rows are cleared, and its
  memory↔code links are re-pointed at the surviving same-fqname symbols.
- `engraphis-graph impact/prs` reject leading-dash git revisions (git option injection), and
  graph exports refuse a symlinked output directory and are written atomically without
  following pre-planted symlinks.
- The unified graph endpoint bounds entity edges and code edges/links per request
  (`limit`-derived cap) so a large workspace graph or indexed repo can't produce unbounded
  viewer-role responses.
- Relay sync fails closed when a workspace's settings are unreadable rather than treating a
  possibly-personal folder as shared: in the sync CLI and in the dashboard/background
  `_sync_all` path; resource extraction enforces its own raw-size cap.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Agent Connect for hosted Team instances.** Members can mint SHA-256-hashed per-user
  bearer tokens in Settings and use the hosted v2 store through `POST /api/remember`,
  the existing read routes, token management under `/api/auth/token*`, and
  `GET /api/auth/connect-info`. Tokens retain the user's role and personal-folder scope;
  viewers are read-only and disabling a user invalidates their tokens immediately.
- **Authenticated MCP-over-HTTP at `/mcp`.** When the MCP extra is installed, the
  dashboard mounts the same 20 tools as the standalone server and injects its existing
  `MemoryService`, avoiding a second SQLite writer. The endpoint requires an active Team
  entitlement and per-user bearer token, enforces viewer/member/admin roles per tool, and
  reports actual mount availability through connect-info.
- **One-click Railway hosting.** Added `railway.json`, the README deploy button, and
  `docs/HOSTING_RAILWAY.md` for persistent volumes, forwarded HTTPS headers, Team
  entitlement bootstrap, member invites, and HTTP/MCP agent connection.
- **Two new MCP context tools.** The MCP inventory grows from 18 to 20 with
  `engraphis_answer`, a compatibility alias for the existing grounded-recall contract,
  and `engraphis_proactive_context`, also available at `POST /api/proactive-context`.
  Proactive packets include bounded task/agent state, cited memories, suggested queries,
  and the previous session handoff. Optional LLM prose is accepted only when every claim
  carries a valid citation.
- **Structured LLM ingestion and consolidation.** `ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=llm_structured`
  validates typed facts, entities, relations, keywords, and confidence; that metadata is
  preserved through storage and automatically feeds the graph. Settings now includes a
  **Connect your LLM** card backed by `/api/llm/status` and `/api/llm/test`.
  Consolidation adds schema-validated facts and explicit source supersession across the
  service, REST, MCP, and CLI surfaces, with deterministic fallback on provider/schema
  failure.
- **Opt-in deterministic memory intelligence APIs.** Added conflict triage for duplicate,
  refinement, contradiction, and obsolete candidates, plus a serializable `UserModel`
  that learns interaction preferences and reranks recall results. These helpers do not
  mutate the store or alter default recall unless a caller invokes them.

### Changed
- **Team mode is opt-out by default.** `ENGRAPHIS_TEAM_MODE=0` (or false/no/off) disables
  Team plumbing. A fresh solo install stays open, first-admin setup requires a live Team
  entitlement, and an existing team's authentication wall remains active if its license
  lapses so private data never becomes public.
- Pre-login license status and trial routes now allow a fresh instance to start a Team
  trial before first-admin setup. Purchased keys bootstrap through
  `ENGRAPHIS_LICENSE_KEY` or the license file; `/api/license/activate` remains admin-only.
- Package fallback metadata and all user-facing tool inventories now agree on version
  `0.9.6` and 20 MCP tools.

### Fixed
- **Agent Connect and dashboard lifecycle:** corrected generated endpoint URLs, retained
  one-time token visibility, made `/mcp` bearer-only, bound MCP sessions to their initiating
  user, rechecked tool roles on every call, retained DNS-rebinding protection, closed
  previously injected stores, and made connect-info reflect the real optional MCP mount.
- **License and Team enforcement:** authoritative revocations override cached entitlement
  and persist tombstones for previously unrecorded keys; transient failures may use only
  an unexpired lease; public license/trial bootstrap routes close after the first Team user;
  trial rate limits trust forwarded addresses only from configured proxies; managed
  requests use explicit client headers; retired managed relay URLs are canonicalized
  across key issuance, license/trial, invite, and sync clients; and configured keys
  that fall back to free after transient outages retry automatically.
- **Python and packaging compatibility:** rate-limit buckets and audit exports use
  timezone-aware UTC APIs, package metadata uses the SPDX license format, and the
  deterministic fallback matches the default embedding model’s 384 dimensions.
- **Memory and retrieval integrity:** audit writes are committed durably, recall excludes
  non-live rows, mixed embedding dimensions no longer crash recall and have a backed-up
  repair path, sync enforces workspace/repository boundaries in both directions, graph
  provenance is pruned per memory instead of deleting shared edges, SQLite-vector distances
  are converted to cosine similarity, entity expansion matches complete names, and the
  sentence-transformers adapters support both legacy and renamed dimension APIs.
- **Structured-data safety:** extraction metadata survives ingest unchanged, proactive and
  consolidation inputs are bounded, structured consolidation rejects source IDs outside
  the requested cluster, and synthesized context cannot replace deterministic output
  without valid citations.
- **Dashboard graph navigation:** focusing an isolated node now retains the requested node
  through the delayed renderer retry instead of reporting a false “Entity not in view.”
- **Dashboard typography:** replaced sub-12px text and the flat type ramp with a consistent
  12/16/24/32px hierarchy while preserving responsive layout.

### Documentation
- Updated the README, Agent Connect, Railway, Kilo Code, bundled memory skill, benchmark
  command, and package-version fallback to match the shipped routes, tool count, setup
  order, and extractor/consolidation options; removed the unused shortcut icon helper.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Team mode is now ON by default (opt-out).** `ENGRAPHIS_TEAM_MODE` defaults to on;
  set `ENGRAPHIS_TEAM_MODE=0` (or false/no/off) to disable. The per-user login wall is
  no longer raised just because the mode flag is on. It now requires a *live* `team`
  feature entitlement (`licensing.has_feature("team")`), checked at request time in
  `dashboard_app.py` and reflected in `/api/auth/state`. Solo / no-license installs stay
  fully open, and the wall appears the moment a team license key is added, even via the
  dashboard UI at runtime. A `team` license is still required to *add seats* beyond the
  first admin (bootstrap admin is created unconditionally). Docs (`.env.example`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `scripts/init.py`) and team-mode test fixtures
  updated.
- **Team-invite email rewritten to separate "join" from "activate a key".** The old
  invite conflated the two, so members pasted the shared team key into the hosted/Railway
  dashboard, saw it "work" (it just re-activated a license already active there), and
  thought they'd joined, when joining means signing in with email + password. The email
  now frames two distinct options: **Option 1** (required to join) sign in to the team
  dashboard with email + the admin-set password, with explicitly *no license key needed here,
  don't paste one*; **Option 2** (optional) run Engraphis on your own machine and access
  the team's memories locally; that is what the shared team key is for (LOCAL
  `http://127.0.0.1:8700` → Settings → License, then Settings → Cloud Sync to pull the
  converged team store down to a local offline copy). Invites now always carry a
  clickable sign-in link: `dashboard_url` resolves explicit arg → `ENGRAPHIS_DASHBOARD_URL`
  → `DEFAULT_TEAM_DASHBOARD_URL` (`https://team.engraphis.com/`). A footer with the
  canonical site + repo links is added as env-overridable module constants
  (`SITE_URL`/`REPO_URL`) so the URLs can't drift per-email. `tests/test_billing.py`.

### Fixed
- **Intermittent `database is locked` from `set_service`.** `routes/v2_api.set_service`
  swapped the global `MemoryService` without closing the previously-bound service's store
  connection, so under heavy test churn a deferred-GC close of the old SQLite/WAL handle
  collided with the next `MemoryService.create` on the same path. The prior store is now
  closed on swap (best-effort, never blocks the swap on a close error).

### Docs
- **README now documents three previously-undocumented shipped features** (the features
  themselves shipped in 0.9.3): sub-file chunking (`ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=chunk` + the
  `eval.chunking_eval` whole-file-vs-chunked harness), auto-dreaming (the background
  cross-cluster-inference loop, accumulation + idle trigger, `dream_inference`
  provenance/auditability), and every automation dream knob exposed via the dashboard
  Automation tab and the `GET/POST /automation` + `POST /maintenance/run` API. Also: a
  **Team early-access beta** callout (top + feature/pricing tables + Free-vs-Pro section)
  and a **daily-update reminder for maintainers** near the top (code wins; fix the doc in
  the same change).

### Chore
- `.gitignore` now excludes `automation.json` / `autosync.json` (regenerable local
  runtime state from `engraphis/automation.py`, not source content).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **The dashboard (`engraphis-dashboard` / `http://127.0.0.1:8700`) would not start.**
  `scripts/start_dashboard.py` runs uvicorn against `engraphis.dashboard_app:app`, but
  `dashboard_app.py` only defined the `create_app()` factory and never built a module-level
  `app` instance, so uvicorn aborted with `Attribute "app" not found` and nothing bound
  port 8700. The missing `app = create_app()` (present in `engraphis/app.py` and
  `engraphis/redirector.py`, but dropped from `dashboard_app.py`) is now restored. The
  background autosync/dreaming/revalidation loops inside `create_app()` are pytest-guarded,
  so importing the module under test is side-effect-free.
- **Flaky `database is locked` dashboard test.**
  `test_consolidate_inference_pass_is_pro_gated` opened two FastAPI `TestClient` lifespans
  back-to-back on the same temp DB file; the first app's still-open SQLite connection
  blocked the second's schema init. Split into two one-client test functions, matching
  the convention already documented above `test_analytics_and_export_*` (two TestClients
  in one test reproducibly deadlock). Full suite now green (693 passed, 3 skipped).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Email-verified self-serve trial + abuse protections on the trial endpoint.**
  Starting a trial now requires a verified email and sends a one-time confirmation link
  before any license is issued; the request path is rate-limited so the endpoint can't be
  used to spam or farm trials. This raises the bar significantly above the previous
  device-only gate while keeping the same paste-a-key activation flow on the dashboard.
  `tests/test_cloud_license.py`, `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`,
  `tests/test_online_only_enforcement.py`.
- **Deterministic, offline sub-file chunking on the write path (`ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=chunk`).**
  A third `Extractor` alongside passthrough/LLM: `ChunkingExtractor` splits a document into
  retrieval-sized `ExtractedFact` chunks that preserve meaning: markdown headings start new
  chunks and become the title, fenced code blocks stay intact, prose is packed to a token
  budget (`ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_TOKENS`, default 256) with a sentence-level overlap
  (`ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_OVERLAP`, default 32); a hard per-document cap
  (`ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_MAX`, default 200) bounds amplification. numpy/stdlib only, so it runs
  under the offline gate and is byte-identical across runs. This gives long, multi-topic
  documents finer retrieval units instead of one diluted memory; the bundled evaluation below
  preserves Recall@5 while reducing retrieved context. New: `ChunkingExtractor` in
  `backends/extractor.py`; `tests/test_chunking_extractor.py`.
- **File/folder imports chunk too.** With `ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=chunk`,
  `import_folder`/`import_files` split each file into several retrieval-sized memories
  (each still `trusted:false`, stamped with `metadata.chunk={index,of,heading}`) instead of
  one; the LLM extractor is deliberately never applied to the local import path (no external
  calls on untrusted disk files). A file still counts as one imported unit.
  `tests/test_import_chunking.py`.
- **Chunking eval + `longdoc` dataset.** `eval/chunking_eval.py` +
  `eval/datasets/longdoc.jsonl` compare whole-file vs chunked ingestion through the real
  recall pipeline. On the offline embedder: identical recall@5 (1.000) at **~73% fewer
  context tokens** (809 → 219) and ~4× smaller tokens-to-evidence (162 → 42); the "quality per token"
  number `BENCHMARKS.md` calls for. `tests/test_chunking_eval.py`.
- **"Dreaming" trigger for automated maintenance.** `automation.should_dream` / `dream_due`
  run a consolidation sweep *before* the cadence when enough new episodic memories have
  accumulated **and** the store has gone quiet (`dream_min_new` / `dream_idle_minutes` policy
  knobs); wired into `scripts/auto_maintain.py`. Purely additive to the existing cadence, so
  cron behaviour is unchanged; still Pro-gated. `tests/test_dreaming_trigger.py`.
- **Associative cross-cluster inference (dream pass 4).** `consolidate.infer_links` /
  `consolidate(infer=True)` proposes evidence-only links between memories in *different,
  dissimilar* subject clusters that share a bridging entity: the "connect distant dots" step
  same-subject distillation never reaches. **Off by default** (`infer=False`); the pass
  follows the sweep's own `dry_run` flag, so a dry-run proposes into the report and a real
  run applies. Applied inferences are low-salience (`importance=0.25`), `trusted:false`,
  `source='dream_inference'`, linked to their sources and audited, so a bad inference is
  visible, downweighted, and never merge-eligible into a trusted fact. Fan-out capped,
  idempotent. Entity matching is now word-boundary (so `Redis` won't fire on
  `rediscovered`) and the per-sweep text scan is computed once, not per entity.
  `tests/test_inference.py`.
- **Inference is reachable from the maintenance path.** A new `infer` policy knob (off
  by default) runs the inference pass inside `run_maintenance`, whether manual or from the dream loop,
  following the sweep's `dry_run`. `/api/consolidate` takes `infer` (`false` by default);
  `/api/automation` round-trips `infer`; the dashboard Automation tab has an Inference
  toggle. `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py` (policy round-trip + `/maintenance/run` proposes the
  Redis bridge), `tests/test_dashboard_dream_ui.py`.
- **Dreaming runs without cron.** A dashboard background loop (`_maybe_start_dreaming`,
  mirroring auto-sync) runs a maintenance sweep whenever `automation.dream_due` fires. It is opt-in,
  Pro-gated, fault-isolated, with an `ENGRAPHIS_DREAM_LOOP=0` kill switch. The `/api/automation`
  policy round-trips the `dream` / `dream_min_new` / `dream_idle_minutes` knobs, and the
  dashboard's Automation tab surfaces them as form controls (toggle + thresholds). The
  trigger now scopes its accumulation/idle count to the policy's `workspaces` (a burst in
  an out-of-scope workspace no longer fires a sweep). `tests/test_dreaming_trigger.py`,
  `tests/test_dashboard_dream_ui.py`, `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`.

### Fixed
- **First-run team-mode bootstrap hardened.** The admin-creation path no longer depends
  on an external relay round-trip succeeding to provision the first seat, and concurrent
  first-admin requests are serialized so only one unlicensed bootstrap admin can ever be
  created. Subsequent seat additions still require an active Team license.
- **First-run team-mode bootstrap fixed (frontend).** The admin-account screen now triggers
  the trial/activation step before provisioning the first admin, so a fresh self-hosted
  instance no longer deadlocks on the team-feature gate with no way to proceed.
  No backend change; frontend-only.
- `MemoryService.create` now defaults `extractor` from `settings.extractor`
  (`ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR`) when unset, mirroring the existing `graph_extractor` fallback so
  the dashboard and automated-maintenance front ends honor the config knob, not just the MCP
  server and CLI. An explicit `extractor="none"` still overrides the environment.

### Security
- **Closed a Pro-feature bypass on the manual consolidate endpoint.** The inference pass
  (a paid capability) was reachable through the free housekeeping endpoint without a
  license; it is now gated at the route and reinforced inside the service layer, so no
  caller can reach the Pro-only path without a server-approved license. The free manual
  consolidate action is unchanged. `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`, `tests/test_inference.py`.
- **Strengthened license enforcement and revocation handling.** Reaffirmed that every paid
  surface requires a live, server-validated lease and fails closed when the server is
  unreachable; tightened the verification so licenses can't be forged client-side, and
  serverside-issued seats can't be minted without a valid license. Revoked or refunded keys
  are now re-confirmed against the server on a background interval so they degrade promptly
  rather than remaining usable until lease expiry, while legitimate offline customers are
  never stalled. `tests/test_online_only_enforcement.py`, `tests/test_cloud_license.py`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Personal vs. shared folders + a redesigned Team dashboard.** A folder can now be
  created `visibility='personal'` (owned by, and visible/usable only to, the creating
  dashboard user) or `shared` (the whole team, the previous, still-default behaviour).
  Enforcement runs through a single workspace-authorization chokepoint, so every scoped
  read/write inherits it and a non-owner cannot access another user's personal folder.
  Personal folders are excluded from relay sync so they stay on-device. The **Team
  dashboard** gains a team overview (seat usage + activity), a Folders panel that creates
  and manages shared/personal folders (folder creation now lives here: the Workspaces
  tab is selection-only in team mode), members with last-active, and a team audit log with
  CSV export. New/updated: `service.py`, `routes/v2_api.py`, `dashboard_app.py`,
  `static/index.html`; tests in `tests/test_personal_folders.py`,
  `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`, `tests/test_sync_dashboard.py`.

### Changed
- README expanded with the missing features (cloud sync, encryption, import/ingest,
  workspace ops, Docker, config, and more) and now links to the Engraphis Discord.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Automatic v1→v2 database migration on startup**: a pre-existing v1-shaped
  `engraphis.db` (no `workspace_id` column) is backed up and migrated to the v2
  schema, so existing installs upgrade cleanly without manual SQL.

### Fixed
- **Dockerfile default entrypoint** is now `engraphis-dashboard --no-open` (was the v1
  single-user `engraphis-server`), so a fresh container serves a working team dashboard
  with auth/license/trial routes instead of a permanently signed-out UI.
  `engraphis-server` remains available as an explicit override for single-user
  deployments.
- **CI**: ruff lint errors and core-floor (numpy-only) test collection.
  fastapi-dependent tests now skip cleanly on the minimal core floor. `loads_strict`
  now rejects pathologically deep JSON on every Python version (3.12's JSON scanner
  no longer raises RecursionError for ~1000-deep input, which had broken the
  deep-nesting parsing guard and its test on 3.12).

## [0.8.8] - 2026-07-13

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Logout no longer re-triggers sign-in modal loop

- Trial start now idempotent (no 400 on repeated calls mid-trial)
- Team trial grants 5 seats (was 1), enabling actual team evaluation
- Dashboard handles empty workspaces gracefully

- Local/offline trial grants removed; trials are server-issued and tracked per device
- Issued keys are server-enforced by default

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Empty workspace `/api/memories` returns `[]` instead of 500
- Online-only license enforcement: cloud-mode keys validated per request

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Static package discovery: `engraphis/static/__init__.py` added
- Vendor glob: recursive pattern so `static/vendor/` bundles ship in wheel
- Dashboard 500 on `GET /`: `static/index.html` was missing from wheel (packaging bug)
- Dashboard 500 on fresh install: `GET /api/memories` crashed on empty workspace
