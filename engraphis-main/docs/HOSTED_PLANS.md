# Local and hosted plans

## Local, free software

The local memory engine, dashboard, MCP server, and manual consolidation are Apache-2.0 and free.
They run on your machine and do not require a cloud account.

## Hosted services

Pro and Team subscriptions provide access to Engraphis hosted services. The private control plane
runs sync, analytics, automation, billing, account management, and Team identity. Those server
implementations are not part of this repository.

Start or manage a hosted subscription in the [Engraphis account portal](https://api.engraphis.com/account?plan=pro&interval=monthly&utm_source=engraphis&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=pro_conversion&utm_content=hosted_plans_pricing#billing).

The email-confirmed, no-card trial lasts three active days. If hosted entitlement expires,
`workspace_write_grace` can retain only approved hosted-account continuity operations for up to
24 hours. It does not extend a trial or subscription, grant cloud access, or affect the free
local tools. `recovery_read_only` supports hosted account recovery and export after grace.

See [Licensing and commercial service boundary](LICENSING.md) for the full source and service
boundary, and [Cloud Sync](SYNC.md) for the sync security model.
