"""Cross-tenant isolation tests for MemoryService — the server-side workspace binding.

Locks in the guarantee that a MemoryService bound to a set of workspaces
(``ENGRAPHIS_WORKSPACES``) refuses every read AND write outside that set — knowing the
name of another tenant's workspace is not enough (``service.py:_authorize_workspace``,
scope is enforced server-side on every read/write — never trust
client-supplied scope alone).

Writes were always guarded; the read paths (recall / why / timeline / stats /
list_workspaces) are the ones that historically were not, so they get the coverage here.
This is the first test over ``service.py`` at all — the isolation boundary was previously
unpinned, so a refactor could have silently reopened it.

Offline only: DeterministicEmbedder + NumpyVectorIndex, no torch (AGENTS.md §3).
