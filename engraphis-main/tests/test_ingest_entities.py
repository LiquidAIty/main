"""Offline tests for engraphis.engines.ingest's entity extraction (the data source
behind the v1 dashboard's interactive Knowledge Graph view). No network or model
download: ingest_document() accepts a pre-computed vector to bypass the real
(sentence-transformers) embedder, which is not part of the offline core dependency set.

Regression coverage for the title/content boundary-bleed bug: naively concatenating
f"{title}\n\n{content}" before running the capitalized-word entity regex let it match
*across* that boundary, fragmenting one real entity (e.g. "Alice Johnson") into several
differently-named graph nodes that each carried only part of its real document set. That
is what made "click a node to see its documents" unreliable in the Graph view — the fix
extracts entities from title and content as separate passes and merges by name.
