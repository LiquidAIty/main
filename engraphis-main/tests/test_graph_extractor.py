"""Offline tests for the free-text -> entity/relation graph feeder
(engraphis.backends.graph_extractor). numpy-only: no model download, no network.

Covers the regex NER (entity types, single-word stopwords, the title/content
boundary regression), the scoped feed() writer (entities+relations land in the
graph, scoped to one workspace and isolated from another), idempotent re-feed,
defanging of untrusted extractor output, the default 'none' no-op, and the opt-in
wiring on MemoryEngine.remember (regex on -> graph populated; default -> empty).
