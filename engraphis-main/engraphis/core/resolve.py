"""Deterministic conflict resolution for the write path.

The original v2 design specs this step as LLM-driven (ADD/UPDATE/NOOP/INVALIDATE via a tool-calling
resolver against the top-K similar memories). House rule AGENTS.md §3.8 keeps ``core/``
runnable on ``numpy`` alone, and v2 has no LLM backend yet — so this is a **deterministic**
resolver, now with two signals: the embedding index narrows candidates (cheap, already
computed at write time) and supplies a cosine-similarity signal, and token-level overlap
on the text itself supplies a precise, embedder-independent signal. An LLM-backed resolver
can be plugged in later behind the same ``resolve()`` signature without touching callers.

It deliberately collapses the original design's UPDATE and INVALIDATE into one ``INVALIDATE``
("supersede") operation — close the old fact's validity, add the new one — because both
must preserve history under the non-negotiable "never overwrite" rule (AGENTS.md §3.2),
and reliably telling "refines" apart from "contradicts" needs semantic judgment that a
deterministic heuristic shouldn't pretend to have.
