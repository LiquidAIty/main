"""Personalized PageRank over the memory/entity graph.

HippoRAG-style single-step graph retrieval: seed the walk at the query's entities and
let the stationary distribution rank everything reachable — multi-hop associations
included — instead of expanding a fixed number of hops. Pure NumPy (AGENTS.md §3.8),
deterministic, and sized for the local-first reality: the adjacency is built per query
from the scoped store (hundreds to low thousands of nodes), where a dense power
iteration is both exact and fast. A sparse/persistent implementation can replace this
behind the same function signature when scale demands it.
