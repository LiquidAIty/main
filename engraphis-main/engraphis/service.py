"""MemoryService — transport-agnostic facade over :class:`MemoryEngine`.

This is the layer the MCP server (and any other front end) calls. It deliberately
has **no MCP dependency**, so it runs and unit-tests offline on ``numpy`` alone
(per AGENTS.md §3). Responsibilities:

* resolve human-friendly ``workspace`` / ``repo`` names to scoped IDs;
* **validate and sanitize all untrusted input** before it reaches the store —
  ingested content is untrusted and memory poisoning is an explicit threat.
  Validation lives here so every front end inherits it;
* return plain JSON-serializable dicts.

The companion :mod:`engraphis.mcp_server` is a thin binding of these methods to
MCP tools; nothing in this module imports ``mcp``.

    v1 (``engraphis/stores/__init__.py``) and v2 (``engraphis/core/schema.py``) both
    happen to name a table ``memories``, but the column sets are unrelated — v1 has no
    ``workspace_id``. ``Store.init_schema()`` runs ``CREATE INDEX ... ON
    memories(workspace_id, ...)`` unconditionally, which is a no-op-safe ``CREATE TABLE
    IF NOT EXISTS`` for a *fresh* db, but crashes with ``sqlite3.OperationalError: no
    such column: workspace_id`` the instant it runs against a pre-existing v1 file —
    e.g. any self-host that ran ``engraphis-server`` (v1) against ``ENGRAPHIS_DB_PATH``
    before ever running ``engraphis-dashboard`` (v2) against that same path. This bit a
    real production deployment on 2026-07-13: switching the default entrypoint to the
    v2 dashboard crash-looped the container against its own pre-existing v1 data.

    Detection: read-only sniff of ``PRAGMA table_info(memories)`` — no ``workspace_id``
    column means v1-shaped (or a table from some other, unrelated database entirely, in
    which case there's nothing safe to do and we leave it for ``Store`` to error on
    normally). A missing file or an unreadable one (encrypted via
    ``ENGRAPHIS_DB_KEY``, corrupt, no ``memories`` table at all) is left alone — the
    normal ``Store()`` path handles a fresh install or surfaces the real error.

    Migration is non-destructive: the original file is copied aside to
    ``<name>.v1-backup-<unix-ts><ext>`` *before* anything else happens, the actual
    migration (:func:`scripts.migrate_to_v2.migrate`) reads the untouched original and
    writes a brand-new file, and only a fully-successful migration is atomically
    swapped into ``db_path`` (:func:`os.replace`). Any failure along the way leaves the
