"""Fixed-query Apache AGE execution for AgentGraph owners."""

# Graph + less = more: less code that does the same work as more code is more useful.
# Entity names the feature; Relationship explains why this file belongs and what it contributes.
# Use codebase-memory-mcp cli to search tags, trace structure both ways, check coverage, then read source.
# Change the smallest existing path; remove what it replaces, never duplicate, and update tags when meaning changes.
# Entity: AgentGraph
# Relationship: This file executes only fixed parameterized AGE queries and converts returned agtype values into Python records for AgentGraph owners.
