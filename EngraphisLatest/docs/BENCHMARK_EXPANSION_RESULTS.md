# Benchmark expansion: evidence and user workloads

Status: **PARTIAL**. The implementation, fixtures, adapters and local execution controls are
available for review. Completed measurements are distinguished from running or blocked work.
No merge, release, publication, paid model call or rented compute is implied by this document.

## Completed external measurements

The full LoCoMo retrieval diagnostic used all 10 conversations and 1,986 questions. The private
source-preparation ledger counted 5,882 ingested dialogue memories; that preparation count is not
carried as a metric in the public retrieval artifact. Of the questions, 1,982 have usable
retrieval labels and 1,538 have answer-token labels; the other denominators are retained
explicitly. The input used four declared annotation repairs/deduplications in the hash-bound v2
repair manifest; original source bytes were preserved.

| Measurement | Result | Boundary |
|---|---:|---|
| Retrieved evidence Recall@10 | 65.51% | Retrieval, not answer correctness |
| Packed evidence Recall@10 | 65.51% | Source IDs represented in the actual 1,500-token context |
| 95% source-conversation bootstrap interval | 63.50–67.76% | One execution; dataset sampling uncertainty |
| Retrieved evidence hit rate | 71.14% | At least one supporting source |
| Answer-token evidence coverage | 60.99% | Lexical evidence diagnostic, not generated-answer grading |
| Mean / maximum evidence context | 471.5 / 724 tokens | RegexTokenCounter estimate; excludes reader instructions and provider usage |

The score artifact is [locomo-full-20260916.json](benchmark-evidence/locomo-full-20260916.json),
with [derived analysis](benchmark-evidence/locomo-analysis-20260916.json) and checksum sidecars.
The full LongMemEval cleaned-S diagnostic also completed all 500 questions. Retrieved evidence
Recall@10 was **97.53%** (95% source-case interval **96.39–98.45%**), while packed evidence recall
was **57.07%** (**54.17–59.92%**). Mean context was 1,499.4 tokens, with a maximum of 1,500.
Answer-token coverage decreased from 80.14% in retrieved memories to 52.62% in packed excerpts
over 470 answer-scored questions. These remain lexical diagnostics, not generated-answer scores.

The source retained 500/500 retrieval-scored questions, omitted twelve declared empty non-answer
turns, and redacted 54 credential-shaped memory records before ingestion. Original source bytes
remain private and unchanged. The score is
[longmemeval-full-20260916.json](benchmark-evidence/longmemeval-full-20260916.json).
The [combined analysis](benchmark-evidence/external-baselines-20260916.json) validates underlying
record counts and derives the intervals. Timings from these runs are diagnostic; concurrent
development/test activity prevents treating them as isolated capacity measurements.

The figure is generated from the checksummed combined analysis:

![External retrieval diagnostic with sample sizes and uncertainty](images/external-retrieval-20260916.svg)

No category was silently dropped. Category IDs 1 and 3 have lower evidence recall (37.75% and
30.41%) than IDs 2 and 4 (70.95% and 74.46%). These are diagnostic failure concentrations;
inspect the private retained question records before assigning a causal explanation. Category 5
is retained for evidence diagnostics and excluded from answer-token scoring as appropriate.

## Strengths, weaknesses and candidate configurations

| User workload | Evidence-supported strength | Limitation or observed weakness | Next bounded action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recall from long conversation history | Increasing k from 10 to 20 raised packed recall from 65.51% to 72.79% at the same 1,500-token cap | Mean context roughly doubled; 27.21% of supporting evidence is still missing on average. Good compression does not prove correct answers | Try the measured opt-in configuration on similar workloads and validate task correctness before adopting it |
| Long sessions with temporal questions | LongMemEval retrieved evidence recall reached 97.53%; a 4,096-token budget retained 81.09% | At 1,500 tokens, packed recall was 57.07%; temporal-category recall fell from 96.06% retrieved to 45.12% packed | The measured larger budget improves evidence retention at roughly 2.73 times the context; validate reader correctness before adopting it |
| Short coding memories and context economy | Existing registered deterministic fixtures demonstrate smaller serialized payload and structure-aware document context | Historical 57.15% payload saving and current 53.88% use different payload measurements; neither is provider billing or task quality | Use compact responses for context economy when the required evidence is retained; test actual Smart/Classic wrapper results separately |
| Corrections, history and cross-session coding work | The executable corpus, real-engine journeys and native OAuth pilot exercise correction lineage, scope and handoff | The pilot uses one synthetic repository family. Its long-document oracle demanded hidden wording and is excluded across every arm; two infrastructure errors remain visible and the unsupported-question category is incomplete | Reconcile the native failed-turn boundary before further execution; validate the repaired corpus across families before selecting a product change |
| Exact configuration and localized labels | The pilot's 12 multilingual cells with memory retained the required evidence | All 12 still failed exact-value execution; source-ID agreement was 11/12. The reader retained only parts of the composite label | Evaluate explicit whole-value copying and structured value fields in a separately frozen experiment; retrieving the source alone does not guarantee a correct edit |
| Mixed documents, reimports, code-memory links | Seven executable journeys cover real v2 functional paths and preserve explicit measurement boundaries | Small fixtures do not establish throughput, multilingual quality, large-import reliability, or public leadership | Retain journey regressions; add observed customer-shaped failure cases to development data with provenance |
| Many memories and multiple agents | Both exact backend paths and the one-host capacity protocol are executable | Until the 24 cells finish, no 100k/16-process latency or throughput conclusion is supported. A second host is still required | Run fresh-process/database repetitions serially, inspect queue-inclusive tails, acknowledgement and erasure integrity before recommending a backend |
| Comparing memory products | Mem0 OSS and Graphiti have pinned local-store adapters and shared budgeted extraction routes | Adapter temporal/history/session limitations remain explicit; unsupported cells cannot establish product inferiority | Complete matched peer pilots and report preprocessing usage, supported subsets and missing attempts together |
| Finding memories relevant to a tool call | The Mem2ActBench small-set diagnostic retrieved 99.82% of labeled sources and packed 99.48% | Source-preparation metadata records 482 memory records across 380 retained cases and 20 source-data exclusions; those counts are not product metrics in the public run artifact. Expected tool-call token coverage was 41.03% after packing, and no action was executed | Treat this as a small evidence-coverage diagnostic; run the upstream action harness before claiming tool success |

The first measured improvement is an **opt-in retrieval-depth configuration** for this LoCoMo
diagnostic. Increasing k from 10 to 20 at the same 1,500-token cap raised retrieved and packed
evidence recall from **65.51% to 72.79%**, a paired difference of **+7.28 percentage points**
(95% source-conversation interval **+6.51 to +8.11**). Mean evidence context increased from
**471.5 to 936.3 tokens**, and maximum context from 724 to 1,359. Packed answer-token coverage
increased from 60.99% to 68.35%; generated-answer correctness remains unmeasured.

The [comparison artifact](benchmark-evidence/locomo-depth-comparison-20260916.json) binds both
complete runs and their configurations. Users with similar short conversation evidence can try
`MemoryEngine.recall(..., k=20, token_budget=1500)` when they can afford roughly twice the evidence
context, then check their own task outcomes. The benchmark used pinned MiniLM and `--no-resolve`
ingestion for annotated dialogues; that ingestion setting is not a general product recommendation.
This exploratory result neither changes defaults nor satisfies the coding holdout gate.

![LoCoMo before and after retrieval-depth comparison](images/locomo-depth-20260916.svg)
The second experiment increased LongMemEval's context ceiling from 1,500 to 4,096 tokens while
holding source, embedding and k=10 fixed. Across all 500 questions, retrieved recall stayed at
97.53%, while packed recall rose from 57.07% [54.17%, 59.92%] to 81.09% [78.37%, 83.57%], a
configuration difference of **+24.03 percentage points** [**+21.68, +26.24**]. Answer-token
coverage rose from 52.62% to 65.12%; mean packed context rose from 1,499.4 to 4,095.1 tokens,
with a 4,096-token maximum. This is one execution with source-case bootstrap uncertainty and no
model-repeat uncertainty. The [comparison artifact](benchmark-evidence/longmemeval-budget-comparison-20260916.json)
binds both reports. No production ranking/default patch is presented without task-level evidence.
The chart retains both budgets and their source-case intervals:

![LongMemEval evidence retained at two context budgets](images/longmemeval-budget-20260916.svg)

The changes already made fix measurement correctness, source reproducibility, budget recovery and
oracle isolation; they do not claim a product quality gain.

## Coding pilot validity and recovery

The original [OAuth pilot artifact](benchmark-evidence/core-pilot-oauth-v2-20260916.json)
retains 58 completed cells, one error and 91 missing cells from the declared 150. Its
[post-run integrity audit](benchmark-evidence/core-pilot-oauth-v2-integrity-20260916.json) joins 81 completed
reader/correction calls to native output and usage. One additional native call reached the
180-second deadline without a completed turn or usage record. Its reservation remains charged;
the call is not retried and its unknown usage is not represented as zero. All 81 completed
repository oracles returned normally, without a Docker timeout or nonzero exit.

The [corpus validity audit](benchmark-evidence/core-pilot-corpus-validity-20260916.json) found
that `long_documents` required an exact sentence absent from the supplied repository, task and
session evidence. Equivalent wording could fail the oracle. The retrospective
[eligibility mask](../eval/configs/benchmark-core-pilot-eligibility-20260916.json) excludes all
15 cells in that category, across all five arms and three budgets. Original corpus bytes,
raw results and the interrupted call remain unchanged and visible. This is a fixture defect,
so these failures cannot establish a weakness in any memory product. The other nine pilot
contracts expose their required values or return conventions.

There are 135 eligible cells. The bound continuation completed 75 of its 90 assigned cells,
then stopped on a native Codex failed turn during a correction. Its first reader call completed,
but the correction has no completed output or usage record; its reservation remains consumed.
No failure was retried. The retained native journal omits the provider error payload, so the
cause cannot be identified as billing, quota, network or model failure from this evidence.

The [combined artifact](benchmark-evidence/core-pilot-combined-20260916.json) retains **133 complete,
2 error and 15 missing raw cells**. After the whole-scenario exclusion, there are **120 complete,
1 error and 14 unattempted eligible cells**. Both raw and eligible execution remain `BLOCKED`.
The original 180-second and continuation 600-second deadlines are separate transport cohorts;
they cannot support an equivalent-latency comparison. The continuation is bound to the original
approval, parent checkpoints, ledger, eligibility audit and source revisions.

Across the eight eligible categories with complete coverage, observed task successes are
1/24 for no memory, 17/24 for full history, and 14/24 each for lexical, dense and hybrid recall.
These descriptive counts share one synthetic family; they do not establish superiority or
non-inferiority. The uncompleted unsupported-question category is not counted as success or
failure in those ratios.

The [continuation audit](benchmark-evidence/core-pilot-continuation-integrity-20260916.json)
joins 131 completed native calls and one failed call. Together with the parent audit, **212
completed calls** have known usage. The generic error checkpoint omitted the already completed
initial call's response/usage and oracle observation, so row-based usage covers only 211 calls;
the durable ledger and native audit retain the additional completed call. Both calls without
usage remain explicit. The audit stays `BLOCKED` on these checkpoint gaps and incomplete
coverage; it does not turn recovered usage into a scored task outcome.

The pilot's ten scenarios all belong to **one repository family**. Repeated arms and budgets
do not create independent repository samples; a clustered 95% quality interval is not estimable
and the one-percentage-point non-inferiority result is **indeterminate**. These are
`implementation_team` diagnostics, not independent-human acceptance. Citation support records
required-source-ID agreement, not independently judged entailment. The abstention field records
answer-presence agreement; it does not independently judge semantic refusal quality. Answer
completeness remains ungraded and answer-token overlap is a separate lexical diagnostic.
The zero critical-violation counter covers the declared evidence and citation checks; it does
not mean every scope-owner or poisoning repository task passed. Those oracle failures remain
task failures in the per-category records and cannot support a security qualification claim.

The multilingual fixture illustrates this distinction. Across the four memory arms and three
budgets, all 12 cells retained the required source, but none preserved the complete target label
in the edited function; 11/12 supplied its required source ID. All three no-memory cells also
failed. A separate read-only review verified the original source/oracle hashes and confirmed
that the full label and exact-copy requirement were supplied in the session evidence. This is
an observed literal-value preservation failure after retrieval, shared across arms, rather than
another hidden-oracle defect. It remains one synthetic fixture, not a general multilingual
quality score. Explicit whole-value copying and structured value fields are future hypotheses;
no measured prompt gain or engine default change is claimed.

Execution commands, recovery rules, matched inputs and public-safe export boundaries are in
[BENCHMARK_EXPANSION_RUNBOOK.md](BENCHMARK_EXPANSION_RUNBOOK.md). Proposed hosted ceilings are
in [BENCHMARK_STAGE_BUDGETS.md](BENCHMARK_STAGE_BUDGETS.md). Status files and checkpoints are
authoritative for a running local queue; a queued command is not a completed experiment.

## Active local execution and validation

The [frozen local queue](../eval/configs/benchmark-local-queue-20260916.json) launched at
2026-09-16 03:04 UTC. At its final checkpoint (2026-09-16 04:06:59 UTC),
Mem2ActBench's 380 retained cases completed with no interrupted-case restarts; its
[public artifact](benchmark-evidence/mem2actbench-small-20260916.json) passed
schema and checksum validation. The LongMemEval 4,096-token comparison also completed and its
[comparison artifact](benchmark-evidence/longmemeval-budget-comparison-20260916.json) passed
schema and checksum validation. MAB conflict-resolution and test-time-learning also completed.
The queue then stopped between jobs because the OAuth implementation changed its source binding.
The [successor manifest](../eval/configs/benchmark-local-queue-final-v4-20260916.json) preserves those
five completions and contains only the four unfinished jobs. Its private execution status is
`.private-eval/benchmark-20260915/local-queue-final/status.json`; a prepared manifest is not a
completion claim. The successor launched at **2026-09-16 07:00:19 UTC** after the model pilot
stopped and the final report checks passed. Its first active job is MAB accurate retrieval;
MAB long-range understanding, the Cognitive slice and the 24-cell capacity matrix follow
serially. Live status and completed artifacts supersede this launch snapshot. No hosted calls
are included in either local queue.

The owner changed model authentication to **Codex OAuth only**. The inherited API gateway is
retired and no top-up of that gateway is needed for this runner. The
[OAuth preflight](benchmark-evidence/codex-oauth-preflight-20260916.json) retains two unscored
setup generations (4,907 input and 30 output tokens). The native app-server generation verified
Luna medium and usage; its first client check exposed a provenance-field mismatch, which was
fixed and covered by an offline integration regression. That failed check remains recorded and
was not retried. Subscription usage is explicitly distinct from the API-price proxy.

Final offline validation at source `cc25ac5b` completed in an isolated checkout with
**5,554 tests passed, 39 skipped, zero failures and errors** in 521.1 seconds.
Unrelated Railway work was excluded from that checkout. Ruff, Pyright for the CI Linux target, commercial-boundary checks,
dashboard asset checks and all seven required offline evaluations also passed. Two suite warnings
were a dependency deprecation and an intentional malformed-ZIP fixture. Native Windows Pyright
has the pre-existing `os.register_at_fork` platform-stub limitation; the CI target reported zero
errors. Tests cover budget exhaustion, crash reservations, source drift, duplicate prevention,
model mismatch, OAuth-only routing, context overflow, redaction, adapters, isolated oracles,
queue heartbeats, Windows process-tree teardown and capacity-summary validation. The final
suite also includes call-ID and public-record integration fixes, continuation allocation/replay
protection, explicit ambiguous-oracle outcomes, post-run native evidence audits and the future
v2 corpus contract repair. The original
[pre-dispatch failure](benchmark-evidence/core-pilot-oauth-predispatch-failure-20260916.json)
is retained with zero provider dispatches. A final **58 report, chart, documentation and public
boundary tests** also passed after the stopped-run artifacts and findings were assembled.
Earlier snapshots remain historical; the selected current deterministic fixture is v18.

These changes are on `codex/benchmark-expansion-20260915`, based on `ca790261`, with exact source
bytes retained in the manifests. They remain local for review. No production
ranking default, independent acceptance decision, merge, publication or product leadership
claim has been promoted.

The [final OAuth validation snapshot](benchmark-evidence/campaign-validation-oauth-20260916.json) binds retained
test-log digests, the selected fixture, unchanged historical artifacts, completed evidence
artifacts and the active queue manifest. It contains no raw dataset text or provider output.
