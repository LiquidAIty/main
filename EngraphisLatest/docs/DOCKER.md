# Docker Compose deployment

## Start the local dashboard

From a fresh clone, start the Docker Compose deployment with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The dashboard is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8700](http://127.0.0.1:8700).

## Persistence and loopback port configuration

A fresh clone needs no `.env`: the service runs `engraphis-dashboard --no-open` and stores the v2
database plus the optional customer-side cloud session and non-authoritative entitlement display
cache on a named volume mounted at `/data`. Generic `.env` settings can supply optional runtime
configuration, but Compose deliberately keeps its container bind address and `/data` paths fixed;
that prevents a desktop `ENGRAPHIS_HOST` or `ENGRAPHIS_DB_PATH` from breaking container reachability
or persistence. To use another loopback port, set `ENGRAPHIS_COMPOSE_PORT` in `.env` or the shell:

```dotenv
ENGRAPHIS_COMPOSE_PORT=8787
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. License issuance, trials, leases, and revocations remain on the private control plane.

The root entrypoint repairs ownership only for the managed `/data` volume. When a custom
container configuration places `ENGRAPHIS_STATE_DIR` outside `/data`, create that directory
with the container's `engraphis` UID as owner and provision its contents for that UID before
startup; external descendants are never recursively repaired. Existing external config parent
directories must also belong to that UID; startup rejects other owners before changing files.
The repair marker lives at `/data/.volume-ownership`, so reusing external state cannot skip
the repair of a replaced data volume. Restarts scan for ownership drift before trusting an
existing marker, repairing restored files when needed without following external symlinks.
Correctly owned volumes avoid recursive ownership writes, but still require a metadata scan.
State directories use mode `0700`; trusted settings must have a single hard link and use
mode `0600`. A container started with
`--user` or `runAsUser` initializes a missing settings file when its state volume is writable
by that runtime UID; it preserves the file on restart.

> Port precedence: the dashboard binds `$PORT` when the platform injects one, falling back
> to `ENGRAPHIS_PORT` (then `8700`). Compose sets both from `ENGRAPHIS_COMPOSE_PORT` so the
> published host port and the in-container bind stay in sync; a stray desktop `ENGRAPHIS_PORT`
> cannot desynchronise them.

## LAN exposure and HTTP MCP

Compose publishes only on loopback by default. To expose it on a LAN, set a strong API token and
the exact URL clients will use:

```dotenv
ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN=<a-long-random-secret>
ENGRAPHIS_DASHBOARD_URL=http://<host-LAN-IP>:8700
```

Then start the token-required LAN overlay (Docker Compose v2.24.4+):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.lan.yml up -d
```

The URL variable alone does not expose or secure the service. The LAN overlay refuses to render
without `ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN`; it replaces the loopback port mapping with an all-IPv4-interface mapping.
After this opt-in, other machines on the LAN can use
`http://<host-LAN-IP>:8700`.

The Docker image includes the streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp/` (the `/mcp` path redirects
there). Configure `ENGRAPHIS_DASHBOARD_URL` to the exact LAN IP or hostname clients use so MCP's
DNS-rebinding protection accepts the request. For example, use
`http://192.168.10.151:8700` for direct LAN access, or `http://engraphis.local` behind Traefik.
For an HTTP-enabled deployment, use the dashboard port (replace `8700` with your
`ENGRAPHIS_COMPOSE_PORT` value when you override it):

```json
{
  "engraphis": {
    "transport": "http",
    "enabled": true,
    "url": "http://<host-LAN-IP>:8700/mcp/"
  }
}
```

When `ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN` is set, configure the client to send
`Authorization: Bearer <ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN>`. Remote requests without a token are rejected.
