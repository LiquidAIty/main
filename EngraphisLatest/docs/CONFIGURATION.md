# Configuration reference

Configuration comes from process environment variables and the owner-private
`~/.engraphis/config.env` file. `ENGRAPHIS_ENV_FILE` can select another absolute, owner-private
regular file. Process variables take precedence, and Engraphis never searches the working
directory for `.env` files.

The table lists the current supported settings. The public package runs in customer mode; hosted
control-plane, relay, compute, and worker implementations are private services.

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ENGRAPHIS_ENV_FILE` | `~/.engraphis/config.env` | Optional trusted config leaf selected before trusted values load. Its bounded dependency-free parser performs no interpolation. An explicit value must be an absolute path to an owner-private regular file; arbitrary working-directory `.env` files are ignored. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_DB_PATH` | Source: `<repo>/engraphis.db`; installed: platform user-data directory | SQLite database file. Installed defaults are `%LOCALAPPDATA%\engraphis\engraphis.db` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/engraphis/engraphis.db` (macOS), and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/engraphis/engraphis.db` or `~/.local/share/engraphis/engraphis.db` (Linux). The environment variable overrides every default; a relative value is resolved from the trusted `~/.engraphis/config.env` directory so launch CWD cannot select a different workspace database. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_SQLITE_DURABILITY` | `durable` | Writable file databases use WAL and FULL commit synchronization. Explicit `balanced` selects NORMAL, which can lose recent acknowledged writes after OS/power failure. Effective settings appear in diagnostics; see [SQLite durability](https://github.com/Coding-Dev-Tools/engraphis/blob/main/docs/SQLITE_DURABILITY.md). |
| `ENGRAPHIS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server bind address |
| `ENGRAPHIS_PORT` | `8700` | Dashboard port. A platform-injected `$PORT` (Railway/Fly/Heroku) takes precedence over this value for the dashboard bind; Compose pins both to `ENGRAPHIS_COMPOSE_PORT` so the mapping stays in sync |
| `ENGRAPHIS_SERVICE_MODE` | `customer` | The public package supports only `customer`; hosted vendor, relay, compute, and worker roles are not distributed here |
| `ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN` | Not set | Optional bearer credential for this single-user local customer node; never reuse a hosted credential |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CORS_ORIGINS` | loopback on `ENGRAPHIS_PORT` | Comma-separated REST CORS allow-list; defaults to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` on the configured port |
| `ENGRAPHIS_INDEX_ROOTS` | Working, home, and temporary directories | Optional path-separator-delimited absolute-path allow-list that replaces the default roots accepted by local code indexing |
| `ENGRAPHIS_HTTP_INDEX_ROOT` | First `ENGRAPHIS_INDEX_ROOTS` entry, or current directory | Single root for dashboard and REST `POST /api/code/index`; submitted paths resolve beneath it. An explicit root (or fallback entry) must be absolute; an explicit HTTP root is included in the engine-approved set. MCP and CLI indexing continue to use `ENGRAPHIS_INDEX_ROOTS`. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_DB_KEY` | Not set | Encrypt the database at rest (SQLCipher). Or use `ENGRAPHIS_DB_KEY_FILE` |
| `ENGRAPHIS_EMBED_MODEL` | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | sentence-transformers model |
| `ENGRAPHIS_MCP_PRELOAD_EMBEDDER` | `auto` | Standalone MCP launchers import optional semantic dependencies on the launcher thread on Windows before serving requests. Set `0` to disable or `1` to enable on any platform; model loading and backend fallback policy remain unchanged. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_EMBED_REVISION` | Not set | Optional immutable lowercase 40-hex Hugging Face commit for the embedding model. Loaded Hub commits or local artifact manifests identify persistent vector spaces; unresolved mutable identities keep vector recall fail-closed. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_RERANK_MODEL` | Not set | Optional sentence-transformers cross-encoder reranker |
| `ENGRAPHIS_RERANK_REVISION` | Not set | Optional immutable lowercase 40-hex Hugging Face commit for the reranker |
| `ENGRAPHIS_REQUIRE_IMMUTABLE_MODELS` | `false` | When enabled, require a 40-hex commit before loading remote embedding models, rerankers, or chunk tokenizers; `local:` selectors and filesystem paths remain permitted |
| `ENGRAPHIS_REQUIRE_EXACT_BACKENDS` | `false` | When enabled, dashboard and standalone MCP startup fails if a configured optional backend is unavailable instead of silently falling back |
| `ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR` | `none` | `none` = verbatim; `chunk` = offline structure-aware chunks; `llm` = free-form LLM facts; `llm_structured` = schema-validated facts + graph metadata |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_TOKENIZER_MODEL` | Not set | Optional Hugging Face tokenizer used to enforce chunk budgets with the downstream reader's real tokenization; requires the optional `transformers` package |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_TOKENIZER_REVISION` | Not set | Optional immutable tokenizer/model revision recorded in the chunk-counter identity; pin this for reproducible benchmark artifacts |
| `ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_EXTRACTOR` | `regex` | `regex` = offline heuristic NER; `none` = disable heuristic text extraction (validated `llm_structured` metadata still feeds the graph) |
| `ENGRAPHIS_RETENTION_SUPERVISOR` | `none` | `none` = deterministic only; `llm` = sends a bounded excerpt to the configured provider for advisory ephemeral/normal/critical classification |
| `ENGRAPHIS_ALLOW_AUTOMATIC_CRITICAL_RETENTION` | `false` | Opt in only when an LLM supervisor may automatically assign the long-lived `critical` class; explicit user-selected critical retention is unaffected |
| `ENGRAPHIS_WHISPER_MODEL` | Not set | Enables local faster-whisper audio/video transcription |
| `ENGRAPHIS_POSTGRES_DSN` | Not set | CLI-only PostgreSQL source; used for the connection and never stored |
| `ENGRAPHIS_POSTGRES_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `10` | PostgreSQL introspection connection timeout in seconds (bounded to 1--120) |
| `ENGRAPHIS_POSTGRES_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-introspection PostgreSQL statement timeout in milliseconds (bounded to 1--300000) |
| `ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_TOKEN` | Not set | Bearer token for `engraphis-graph-server`; required off-loopback |
| `ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_HOST` / `ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `8720` | Read-only graph/recall server bind address |
| `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai` | `openai \| anthropic \| google \| openrouter \| custom` |
| `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model name (provider-specific) |
| `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_API_KEY` | Not set | API key for chat/synthesis, `llm` / `llm_structured` extraction, and structured consolidation |
| `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_BASE_URL` | Not set | Base URL for openrouter / custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints |
| `ENGRAPHIS_DECISION_BACKEND` | `none` | `none` or `local` keeps advisory decisions local; `managed` uses the saved Cloud session and an included per-person rolling allowance after service acceptance; `auto` selects managed when configured and never switches to BYOK; explicit `byok` uses a personal TypeSafe key and may incur provider charges. Managed custom questions and query planning are unsupported. Legacy `typesafe`, `jev`, and `system1` mean BYOK. Remote calls also require per-call consent. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_DECISION_MODEL` | `jev-1.13.0` | Pinned model accepted by the Jev transport; other model identifiers are rejected. |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | Not set | Personal credential for explicit BYOK decisions; `JEV_API_KEY` is a fallback alias. Managed decisions use the saved Cloud session instead. |
| `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` | `https://api.typesafe.ai` | Direct BYOK provider origin; does not change the managed session's bound Cloud control origin. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_AUTO_EXTRACT` | `0` | Opt in to switching the running engine to `llm_structured` after a successful live connection test; the dashboard's extraction Off button persists `0`, and its On button restores `1` |
| `ENGRAPHIS_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` | *(none)* | Proxies trusted for forwarded client/TLS headers (`*` only when the service is reachable exclusively through that proxy) |
| `ENGRAPHIS_LOCAL_TRUSTED_PEERS` | *(none)* | Exact peers/CIDRs treated as local without forwarding headers; use only for trusted Docker/LAN peers, never public deployments |
| `ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_CACHE` | `86400` | Update-check cache TTL in seconds, bounded to `1..31622400`; this is never a cache-file path |
| `ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_CHECK` | Off | Opt-in release reminder surfaced in the dashboard, server startup log, and MCP. Update checks run only when this is set to an affirmative value; `0` keeps them off. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_URL` | Not set | Overrides the release-check source URL; the outbound client accepts HTTPS and rejects private/reserved destinations. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_CONTROL_URL` | hosted default | Official entitlement, organization, and credential control API. A saved rotating credential stays bound to the control endpoint recorded for its family; reconnect to change it. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_COMPUTE_URL` | hosted default | Official Analytics and managed-automation API. A saved rotating credential stays bound to its recorded compute endpoint; reconnect to change it. |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID` | Not set | Hosted organization bound to this customer session |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_REFRESH_CREDENTIAL` | Not set | Bootstrap-only rotating hosted credential; after first use the owner-only cloud session replacement takes precedence |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_TOKEN_SUBJECT` | `member` | Subject fixed during hosted bootstrap (`device` or `member`); set explicitly with an environment-only refresh credential |
| `ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Not set | Optional short-lived access token for ephemeral jobs |
| `ENGRAPHIS_MANAGED_COMPUTE_CONSENT` | *(unset)* | Deny-only operator override: `0` pauses readable managed processing. A truthy value cannot grant approval. Each workspace requires explicit confirmation in Manage → Settings; encrypted sync is separate |

Managed Jev is currently `not_yet_available` pending release acceptance and
service-capacity qualification; client configuration does not enable it. After
enablement, every legitimate Pro user and each eligible Team named seat, including paid
viewers, with an active paid, trial, or test entitlement receives managed Jev at no
additional customer charge and without a personal provider key.

Each individual receives all three independent rolling limits: **100 evaluated questions per rolling hour, 1,000 per rolling five hours, and 2,000 per rolling 24 hours**. Usage is per
person, not pooled across a Team and not monthly. Each evaluated question counts once;
if a batch is evaluated, every question counts. A `guard_command` review evaluates two
questions, and each other supported workflow evaluates one. Admitted attempts that fail
or are interrupted remain counted. No overage is charged. The account portal reports
that member's remaining usage across all three windows; usage returns as earlier
questions leave each rolling window.

The existing production fleet guard remains 100 questions per day across the service. It
conflicts with the per-person rolling caps and may pause or reject requests earlier, so
resolve capacity and the fleet guard before launch. No latency, accuracy, or cost-saving
guarantee is established by configuration or a successful health check. These rules are
service-enforced, not client configuration overrides. Selecting a backend does not
enable the service or satisfy release, provider-terms, capacity, or quality gates. See
[hosted plans](HOSTED_PLANS.md#included-system-1-decision-engine-jev).

The four managed workflows require a command, a pair of facts, query/evidence, or
goal/output context and their fixed question schemas. Arbitrary `custom` and
`query_planning` payloads are rejected before credential refresh or network requests.
Experimental recall route planning requires explicit BYOK; managed failure never
silently selects a personal key. Remote consent and `public` or `internal`
classification remain mandatory, and `offline_mode=true` prevents remote requests.
Viewers can use direct Classic advisory decisions; generic Smart stateful execution
still requires admin and the private Team tool catalog is unchanged.

Managed transport callers can supply `request_key` for explicit retry deduplication. A
duplicate admitted key returns 409 without an additional provider call or usage
increment; there is no stored answer replay or automatic retry. Admitted errors remain
counted. This parameter is not an environment setting or an MCP/dashboard field.

The optional cross-encoder reranker is model- and hardware-dependent. Treat its quality and
latency as deployment-specific until a versioned model identity, exact configuration, and
reproducible evaluation artifact are available for the comparison being reported.

See [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for the full variable inventory. Supply values through the
process environment or the trusted config file above; copying it to an arbitrary `./.env` does
not make Engraphis load it.
