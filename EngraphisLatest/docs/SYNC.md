# Cloud Sync

Engraphis remains local-first: the free engine stores memories in local SQLite and works
without an account or network. **Cloud Sync** is a hosted Pro/Team service that connects
authorized installations through Engraphis-managed relay storage.

The public repository contains the customer-side protocol, deterministic merge engine, and
relay client required to participate in that service. It does **not** contain the hosted relay,
organization authorization, entitlement registry, storage credentials, automatic scheduler, or
operations tooling. An environment variable cannot turn the public image into the official relay.

## Product boundary

| Layer | Public Apache package | Private hosted service |
|---|---|---|
| Local memory database and free engine | Yes | No requirement |
| Deterministic bundle/merge protocol | Yes | Uses the same contract |
| Customer relay client | Yes | Authenticates it |
| Relay storage and tenant isolation | No | Yes |
| Device registration and credential rotation | Client only | Authority |
| Organization membership and named seats | No | Yes |
| Automated cloud cadence and operations | No | Yes |

The split is deliberate. Local checks in Apache-licensed code are not DRM and can be changed by
a fork. The paid boundary is authorization to use the official private service and its operated
infrastructure.

Cloud Sync is available with hosted Pro and Team plans. See [local and hosted plans](HOSTED_PLANS.md)
for pricing and included services.

## Trial and grace

The no-card Pro or Team trial begins after email confirmation and lasts **7 active days for Pro or 14 active days for Team**.

`workspace_write_grace` is separate and private-service enforced. It may preserve bounded
hosted-account continuity operations for at most **24 hours** following an authoritative
entitlement denial. It never extends the trial or subscription, and it never grants Cloud Sync,
Analytics, Automation, Auto Dreaming, Auto Consolidation, Team access, seats, or credentials.
Cloud access may stop immediately. The free local sync-folder primitive and local core are not
gated by this hosted lifecycle state.

## Configure a customer installation

Hosted onboarding creates an owner-only cloud session under `~/.engraphis` (or
`ENGRAPHIS_STATE_DIR`). For non-interactive clients, inject credentials through a secrets manager:

```dotenv
ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_CONTROL_URL=https://api.engraphis.com
ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_COMPUTE_URL=https://compute.engraphis.com
ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID=org_replace_me
ENGRAPHIS_CLOUD_REFRESH_CREDENTIAL=<secret>
```

The refresh credential rotates. Refresh is serialized across threads and cooperating processes,
and the client stores only the replacement needed for the next session in an owner-only file.
After the first rotation, that saved replacement and its control/compute URLs are one credential
family: they take precedence over environment bootstrap values, and environment URL changes
cannot redirect that bearer credential. Reconnect with a fresh portal token to change endpoints.
For unattended configuration, use process variables or the owner-private
`~/.engraphis/config.env`; an explicit `ENGRAPHIS_ENV_FILE` must be an absolute owner-private
regular file. Engraphis does not search the working directory for `.env`. Do not place credentials
in source, documentation, container images, shell history, or support logs.

The one-shot customer client remains available for explicit sync operations:

```bash
python -m scripts.sync \
  --db engraphis.db \
  --workspace acme \
  --relay https://relay.engraphis.com
```

Cloud Sync is fail-closed: install `engraphis[cloud-sync]` on Python 3.10+ and provision a
32-byte URL-safe-base64 workspace key as `ENGRAPHIS_SYNC_E2EE_KEY` on every authorized device
through a secrets manager. Generate it once on a trusted device and transfer it only through your
own secure channel; Engraphis Cloud never receives, derives, or recovers this key. Relay
authorization normally comes from the owner-only saved cloud session. An unattended
`ENGRAPHIS_SYNC_TOKEN` also requires `ENGRAPHIS_SYNC_TOKEN_ORIGIN` matching the relay origin, so a
credential cannot be redirected. The CLI intentionally has no secret-valued `--relay-token` or
`--relay-e2ee-key` flags. A missing or malformed key stops Cloud Sync rather than uploading a
plaintext bundle.

`engraphis connect --token ...` saves the Cloud account session; it does not create or save the
separate encryption key. Set `ENGRAPHIS_SYNC_E2EE_KEY` in the process environment or the
owner-private `~/.engraphis/config.env`, then restart the local dashboard. The Sync status shows
only whether the key is valid and the local encryption dependency is installed, never the key
itself. A read-only pull still needs the same key to decrypt received bundles.

```bash
python -c "import base64, secrets; print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode().rstrip('='))"
```

Treat the command output as a secret: use a trusted terminal without transcript or log capture,
store it in your secret manager, and never paste it into the Cloud portal or a support request.
Before the first upload, keep a separate secure backup and confirm you can retrieve it. If the
key is lost, previously synced encrypted bundles cannot be decrypted; Engraphis Cloud cannot
restore it.

For the first device, add a single `ENGRAPHIS_SYNC_E2EE_KEY=<your key>` assignment to its
owner-private `~/.engraphis/config.env` with a trusted editor, retaining any existing settings.
Use the path named by `ENGRAPHIS_ENV_FILE` instead when that override is configured. A secrets
manager may inject the same process variable instead of using the file. Restart the dashboard,
then check **Settings → Cloud Sync**: Connection must show **Connected**, Encryption key
**Valid**, and Sync readiness **Ready** before **Sync now** is enabled. If encryption support is
missing, install `engraphis[cloud-sync]` in the dashboard's Python environment and restart.
On each additional device, provision the *same* backed-up key through your secure channel;
generating a different key will make earlier encrypted bundles unreadable there.

The dashboard's **Sync now** action invokes the same customer protocol. The public package does
not run a local auto-sync loop or ship a cron/Task Scheduler wrapper. Hosted automation belongs
to the private service. A round with any incomplete workspace is a failure, even when other peers
were applied successfully: the bounded report retains those good-peer totals, labels the result
`incomplete`, and the CLI exits `1`. The dashboard therefore never presents a partial round as
successful. An all-workspace entitlement denial still returns the hosted Pro/Team recovery CTA.

### Local folder transport

The public protocol also retains a manual folder transport for development, backup interchange,
and offline testing:

```bash
python -m scripts.sync \
  --db engraphis.db \
  --workspace acme \
  --remote /path/to/shared-folder \
  --dry-run
```

This is a customer-controlled file exchange primitive, not the official Cloud Sync service. It
has no hosted identity, seat, availability, support, or managed-storage guarantees.
Folder caps, oversize omissions, and snapshot races are observable incomplete failures rather than
successful partial backups.

Anyone who can write to the shared folder can also choose the target `workspace_name`, so
content arriving from a peer you do not control should be treated as untrusted: it is
quarantined under local `trusted: false` provenance until you review and approve it.

Operator note: the `operation_receipts`, `events`, and `audit` tables in the local SQLite
database grow append-only by design - rows are hash-chained, and pruning them would break
chain verification. Watch their size in the database file (for example with
`sqlite3 engraphis.db "SELECT count(*) FROM operation_receipts"`) when planning capacity;
the supported path for long-lived installations is archiving or rotating the whole database,
not deleting rows.

### Secure erasure, confirmation, and rotation

`MemoryService.secure_erase()` (and `engraphis_secure_erase` / `POST /api/secure-erase`)
is confirm-gated: it requires explicit local-operator confirmation
(`confirmed=True`; `confirmed=true` over MCP). Without it the call fails closed with a
validation error. `engraphis_forget` remains a deprecated retire-with-history alias: it never deletes,
and its responses now say so and point at `secure_erase`.

On success the response carries the Store's `impact` report alongside the erase result:
`receipt_refs` / `event_refs` (content-free references touched by the erasure),
`backup_note` (which recognised local recovery backups were scanned), and
`wal_vacuum_status` (whether secure-delete/WAL/VACUUM maintenance completed). The
erasure itself is recorded in the hash-chained audit trail.

Rotation runbook for a leaked credential (erasure is local-only remediation, not
universal deletion):

1. Rotate or revoke the credential first: erasure cannot recall data an agent
   already read.
2. Run the confirmed `secure_erase` and read the `impact` report: confirm
   `wal_vacuum_status`, note `receipt_refs` / `event_refs`, and follow `backup_note`.
3. Remediate separately everything Engraphis cannot erase: filesystem snapshots,
   copied/exported databases, cloud backups, and remote sync peers that have not yet
   accepted an eligible `remote_erasure` marker. `never_export` markers (secret,
   session, reserved user-scope, migrated legacy) stay local and never notify peers.

Peer erasures are never applied blindly. A `remote_erasure` tombstone for a locally
quarantined or pending-review row is *held* for operator review: local bytes stay
quarantined (visible in the review queue), nothing is deleted, and the hold is
reported as `tombstones_held` with a `sync_tombstone_held` audit event, never
silently dropped. Operators may additionally configure `SyncEngine(...,
erase_device_allowlist={...})` so erasures asserted by any other device are held the
same way. These holds complement the per-device generation/hash-chain rollback gate,
which still rejects stale or forked snapshots before anything is applied.

## Merge semantics

Sync exchanges bounded workspace snapshots and merges them deterministically. Existing
bi-temporal history is preserved: conflicts close validity windows or create explicit successor
records rather than destructively overwriting facts. The public merge code is necessary so a
customer can verify how their local database changes.

Session scope is strictly device-local. Every exported workspace or repo bundle excludes both
live and invalidated session-scoped rows, as well as `secret` rows, and includes a memory link only
when both endpoints remain in the export. Inbound legacy or untrusted bundles cannot create,
relabel, or overwrite session-scoped state because the sync format carries no authenticated
session owner or lifecycle contract.

Bundle format v3 preserves durable claim identity and the system-time at which a world-time
invalidation was learned. It also carries a per-device `generation`, `previous_hash`,
`state_hash`, and `tombstone_checkpoint`. Engraphis pulls its own device's remote snapshot before
replacement and rejects an observed generation/hash-chain rollback. Current clients accept
inbound v1 and v2 bundles for compatibility but export v3; older clients reject unknown versions
instead of silently forwarding a downgraded snapshot.

Erasure markers remain content-free and carry an `export_class`. Export includes only
`remote_erasure` markers created for non-secret workspace/repo records that were eligible for
sharing. Local `never_export` markers, including migrated legacy markers and erasures of secret,
session, or reserved user-scope records, never leave the device. Bundle import rejects any
tombstone not explicitly classified `remote_erasure`; a local `never_export` marker cannot later
be upgraded to an exportable one.

The first contact with a relay is deliberately `incomplete` and unanchored until the managed
service supplies an authenticated workspace manifest/checkpoint. A local client can prove that an
observed device chain did not roll back; it cannot prove that an untrusted relay did not withhold a
device it has never observed.

Bundle input is untrusted. The client validates schema and size limits before applying records,
rechecks workspace scope, and retains provenance/audit evidence. Every inbound memory is re-homed
under local `source: sync, trusted: false` provenance; a peer's serialized trust label, graph
metadata, retention hints, or extractor output has no authority. Suspicious payloads are
quarantined before indexing. A relay cannot inject a record outside the authorized workspace
merely by changing bundle fields.

An inbound bundle also cannot overwrite a locally approved memory with the same id. The local
record remains the safe winner and a content-free `sync_trust_conflict` audit event records a
competing peer payload. This intentionally favors integrity over automatic last-writer-wins for
cross-trust collisions; promote/approve a fresh local record if the peer's information is verified.
Likewise, unauthenticated bundle links may connect only records that remain in the untrusted
replica; a peer cannot attach graph edges to locally approved memories.

## Security and privacy

- Local-only installations send no memory content to Engraphis. **Cloud Sync encrypts eligible
  shared-workspace changes end-to-end before they leave this device. Engraphis Cloud cannot read
  their contents; secret and session-scoped memories stay local.** Managed compute is separate:
  explicit workspace approval in Manage → Settings is required before readable uploads;
  connecting an account does not grant it. A deny-only operator override is available with
  `ENGRAPHIS_MANAGED_COMPUTE_CONSENT=0`. Approved processing sends a readable, bounded
  snapshot over TLS because Engraphis Cloud must process that snapshot to produce results.
- Treat cloud session and refresh files as credentials; keep their directory owner-only.
- `secret` memories are excluded from managed uploads. Managed compute also rejects secret rows
  server-side.
- Cloud Sync's end-to-end encryption applies to sync bundles, not to managed-compute snapshots or
  content deliberately submitted to a configured LLM provider. Those processors must be able to
  read the submitted content to perform the requested work.
- Cloud Sync uses a fresh ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce for each upload and authenticates the stored
  opaque bundle name plus workspace as associated data. The relay can store or replay ciphertext,
  but a tampered, renamed, cross-workspace, wrong-key, or legacy plaintext bundle is rejected
  before it reaches the merge engine.
- Device credentials are not seats. Team seats are named organization members managed by the
  hosted control plane.
- Revocation and expiry are authoritative server decisions. A locally modified client does not
  acquire service access without a valid hosted credential.

## What Apache forks can do

Apache-2.0 rights in code already published here are perpetual under that license and cannot be
clawed back. A fork may alter or reuse the public client and merge protocol. That does not grant
access to Engraphis-operated infrastructure, private service code, signing keys, customer data,
support, or trademarks.

This is why future defensible value lives in the private hosted relay, compute, identity,
automation, security operations, and customer experience rather than in a local feature flag.
