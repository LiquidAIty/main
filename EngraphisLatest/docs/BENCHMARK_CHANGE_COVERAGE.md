# Benchmark change coverage

This is the change-to-evidence map for the screenshot reference at `a4c19eee76163bd4e4435ae5724472f51a1ed5f3`, the `v1.7.4` release at `ea6ed79c6d86e69f98b075614e64e50d9fd24d11`, and the campaign's frozen pre-expansion main endpoint at `ca790261f499e0d124cdc7131235ffff89637248`. The subsequent benchmark implementation is recorded in local commits `11abc345`, `7370e148` and `cc25ac5b`; the original OAuth pilot binds `7370e148` and its eligible continuation binds `cc25ac5b`. This is a historical capability inventory, not a claim that remote main still has the same head.

The screenshot commit is not an ancestor of current `main`. The two histories meet at
`54c9985aa41304d8420437d388b7ee8ac1be56dd`, so a direct two-dot diff would mix branch-only
changes with the chronological release history. This map uses the screenshot commit as the
visual baseline, then uses the current first-parent history, `CHANGELOG.md`, current source, and
current tests for the capability inventory. It does not infer a user outcome from a file diff.

The screenshot's tiny synthetic evidence remains historical context: 35/35 quality on its fixture
and three graph questions. Its 98.21% replay-volume panel is retired because a matching retained
result artifact was not found. These image claims are not coding-agent
session outcomes, independent repository evidence, model-comparison results, or an end-to-end quality
claim. The current public numeric registry is the checksum-bound record in
[`BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md) and [`docs/benchmark-evidence/offline-fixtures-v36.json`](benchmark-evidence/offline-fixtures-v36.json).

The audit inputs are reproducible with `git show -s --format=fuller a4c19eee`,
`git show -s --format=fuller ea6ed79c`, `git show -s --format=fuller ca790261`,
`git merge-base a4c19eee ca790261`, and `git log --first-parent --format='%h %ad %s'
54c9985a..ca790261`. The capability descriptions come from the current
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), current source and tests, and the evidence contracts in
[`docs/RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md`](RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md), [`BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md), and
[`docs/PUBLIC_BENCHMARK_RUNBOOK.md`](PUBLIC_BENCHMARK_RUNBOOK.md).

## Evidence status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CHECKED_IN_ARTIFACT` | A current checksum-bound artifact exists and its metric boundary is stated. |
| `LOCAL_GATE` | A deterministic evaluator or focused regression command exists in the current tree. This label does not mean it was rerun for this document. |
| `PARTIAL` | Local tests or plumbing cover part of the behavior, but a user-outcome, independent, external, browser, or production-like measurement is missing. |
| `NOT_RUN` | The command or protocol is available, but no result is claimed here. |
| `BLOCKED` | A required dataset, paid/provider call, protected authority, attended browser/host, or independent reviewer is absent. |

A benchmark row must keep task success, evidence retention, citation support, answer completeness,
answerable abstention, critical violations, context usage, and operational timing as separate fields.
Token overlap is an answer-token diagnostic and is never a semantic completeness score. A missing
gold evidence set is `N/A`, not a perfect retention result. The local coding corpus is explicitly
implementation-authored synthetic plumbing and cannot stand in for independent human-authored
coding tasks.

## Capability coverage

### Evidence, retrieval, and coding outcomes

| Change and user outcome | Executable benchmark, metric, and evidence | Status and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Screenshot context-efficiency visual and its later checksum-bound replacement (`a4c19eee`, `078370ee`, `e25eb0ab`, `bb3a8f05`) | `python -m eval.chunking_eval --dataset eval/datasets/longdoc.jsonl --k 5`; `python -m eval.performance --dataset eval/datasets/codemem.jsonl --k 5 --iterations 10 --json <report.json>`; `python scripts/render_benchmark_report.py --report docs/benchmark-evidence/offline-fixtures-v36.json --output <svg>`; `tests/test_benchmark_evidence.py` | `CHECKED_IN_ARTIFACT` for v36 fixture values, source/config/suite digests, and the rendered SVG. Historical v35, v33, v32, v31, v30, v29, v28, v27, v26, v25, v24, v23, v22, v21, v20, v19, and v18 values, plus screenshot values, are retained only as historical evidence. Transport bytes, provider billing, and end-to-end model quality are not measured. |
| Core retrieval arms, temporal facts, scope filters, graph expansion, retention, and rank-sensitive quality (`3b5d4b12`, `3258aeb9`, `139cbb47`, `18329d8c`, `4e327f51`) | `python -m eval.harness --dataset eval/datasets/sample.jsonl --k 5`; repeat for `codemem.jsonl` and `graph_multihop.jsonl`; `python -m eval.ablation`; `tests/test_bitemporal_recall.py`, `tests/test_recall.py`, `tests/test_context_scope_grounding.py`, `tests/test_graphrank.py` | `LOCAL_GATE`. Metrics are recall@k, hit@k, MRR, nDCG, and temporal/scope correctness on implementation-authored fixtures. This is retrieval evidence, not coding-agent task success or a neutral ecosystem ranking. |
| Optional sentence-transformer/cross-encoder retrieval, embedding-space provenance, native exact KNN, and safe fallback (`18329d8c`, `4e327f51`, `d7d597ce`) | `python -m eval.harness --dataset eval/datasets/codemem.jsonl --k 5`; `python -m eval.agent_benchmarks --help`; `tests/test_backends_factories.py`, `tests/test_vector_sqlitevec_backend.py`, `tests/test_native_coverage_equivalence.py` | `PARTIAL`. Full LoCoMo and LongMemEval retrieval diagnostics now use pinned semantic MiniLM with checksummed artifacts; see [measured results](BENCHMARK_EXPANSION_RESULTS.md). They do not establish reranker, competitor or coding-task superiority. |
| Grounded answers, citations, abstention, and poisoned-memory exclusion (`e25eb0ab`, `18329d8c`, `d7d597ce`) | `python -m eval.grounded`; `python -m eval.adversarial_memory_security`; `python -m eval.redteam_poisoning`; `tests/test_grounded.py`, `tests/test_context_scope_grounding.py`, `tests/test_poisoning.py`, `tests/test_rescan_poisoning.py` | `LOCAL_GATE`. Reports answerable grounding, unsupported abstention, quarantine, and authorization boundaries. No LLM answer-quality or customer study is asserted. |
| Reworded mutable-fact correction, false-NOOP protection, temporal splice narrowing, and batch write resolution (`439aec4f`, `d83b324f`, `550602d7`, `0d607f4b`, `d8c97d90`) | `python -m eval.resolver_reworded_corrections --strict`; `python -m eval.coding_acceptance --fixture`; `tests/test_resolve.py`, `tests/test_resolver_acceptance.py`, `tests/test_remember_many.py`, `tests/test_storage_concurrency_repair.py`, `tests/test_release_write_path.py` | `LOCAL_GATE` for deterministic 44-pair and real-write fixtures. The 44 pairs are implementation-authored and do not prove independent mutable-fact generalization. |
| Ebbinghaus retention, interaction reinforcement, proactive agenda, and decay trajectories (`3b5d4b12`, `18329d8c`, `d7d597ce`) | `python -m eval.reinforcement`; `python -m eval.proactive_ranking`; `tests/test_retention.py`, `tests/test_decay_idempotent.py`, `tests/test_proactive_context.py`, `tests/test_proactive_ranking.py` | `LOCAL_GATE`. Metrics are deterministic retention/ordering trajectories and bounded stability on fixtures. They do not measure a user's long-run productivity or recall quality. |
| Code-symbol retrieval and memory bridges, including same-file call fallback (`813475ff`, `45ed3200`) | `python -m eval.code_arm`; `tests/test_eval_code_arm.py`, `tests/test_code_recall_arm.py`, `tests/test_codegraph.py`; repository indexing through `tests/test_service.py` | `LOCAL_GATE` for code evidence retrieval and symbol/call plumbing. No model-generated coding patch success or held-out repository result is claimed. |
| Adaptive context, planned recall, context routing, source-unit retention, and context savings (`2fce865d`, `17aa1d6f`, `a8eeed02`, `439aec4f`, `d7d597ce`) | `python -m eval.context_economy --dataset eval/datasets/codemem.jsonl --token-budget 512 --k 5`; `python -m eval.productivity --dataset eval/datasets/codemem.jsonl --max-context-tokens 512 --retrieval-token-budget 256`; `python -m eval.planned_recall`; `python -m eval.performance --dataset eval/datasets/codemem.jsonl --k 5 --iterations 10 --json <report.json>`; `tests/test_context_economy.py`, `tests/test_context_evidence_preservation.py`, `tests/test_adaptive_context.py`, `tests/test_planned_recall_eval.py` | `PARTIAL`. The measurable fields are task/retrieval quality, packed token count, source completeness, citations, and omissions. The historical 49-fact savings point is a fixture observation, not an ecosystem result; no provider token bill or end-to-end coding benefit is claimed. |
| Implementation-authored coding corpus, repository oracle, reader callback, family-clustered holdout, and separate five-arm acceptance binding (`d7d597ce`, `ea6ed79c`, current campaign work) | `python -m eval.coding_corpus --materialize --verify`; `python -m pytest tests/test_coding_corpus.py -q`; `python -m eval.coding_acceptance --corpus eval/datasets/coding_memory_v1/manifest.json --fixture`; campaign wiring is described in [`docs/CODING_ACCEPTANCE_CORPUS.md`](CODING_ACCEPTANCE_CORPUS.md) | `PARTIAL`. The 400 scenarios are implementation-authored synthetic disposable repositories with 40 family IDs in ten template groups. Eight development, eight validation, and 24 held-out families are structurally reserved, but this is not independent human or real-customer evidence. |
| Additional public datasets and adapters: MemoryAgentBench, LoCoMo-Plus, and Mem2ActBench (`d1be5bc6`, `a4c19eee`, current adapter) | `python -m eval.agent_benchmarks --dataset <JSON-or-JSONL> --format <format> --k 5 --json <report.json> --artifact <artifact.json>` where `<format>` is one of `memoryagentbench`, `locomo_plus`, or `mem2actbench`; source pins, private prepared inputs, and boundaries are in [`docs/ADDITIONAL_BENCHMARK_DIAGNOSTICS.md`](ADDITIONAL_BENCHMARK_DIAGNOSTICS.md) and [`eval/configs/additional-benchmark-sources.json`](../eval/configs/additional-benchmark-sources.json) | `PARTIAL`. The 380-case Mem2ActBench retrieval diagnostic is complete with 20 declared exclusions; Two MemoryAgentBench splits are complete; the other two and the LoCoMo-Plus Cognitive slice remain queued. LoCoMo-Plus all-category loading remains `BLOCKED` by upstream missing-answer and missing-evidence rows. These adapters do not reproduce upstream LLM judges, agent orchestration or tool execution. |
| LongMemEval V2, LoCoMo evidence repair, external retrieval, and model-dependent evaluation (`a4c19eee`, `18329d8c`, current repair manifests) | `python -m eval.external --dataset <pinned-dataset> --format locomo --offline --limit 2`; full external command in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md); `python -m eval.run_longmemeval_v2 --help`; `tests/test_eval_external.py`, `tests/test_benchmark_longmemeval_v2.py` | `PARTIAL` overall. Full-source LoCoMo and LongMemEval retrieval diagnostics are `COMPLETE`, with pinned model/source bytes, packed-evidence metrics, confidence intervals and retained artifacts in [the results report](BENCHMARK_EXPANSION_RESULTS.md). Official LongMemEval-V2 remains `BLOCKED` on resources and a qualified OAuth judge path. No leaderboard or end-to-end QA score is claimed. |
| Operational memory capacity at 100k memories and multiple agents (`2fce865d`, `d1be5bc6`, `ea6ed79c`, [`docs/ENGINE_CAPACITY_PROTOCOL.md`](ENGINE_CAPACITY_PROTOCOL.md)) | `python -m eval.local_capacity_campaign --help`; `python -m eval.engine_capacity --help`; `python -m pytest tests/test_capacity_matrix.py tests/test_engine_capacity.py tests/test_local_capacity_campaign.py -q` | `PARTIAL`. Both four-process backend smokes completed with 100 operations and no observed correctness failures. The serial local queue includes all 24 current-host cells with five fresh repetitions each. Those queued cells are not observed results; no 100k end-to-end capacity claim exists. |

### Documents, sync, storage, and multi-agent state

| Change and user outcome | Executable benchmark, metric, and evidence | Status and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Universal local document import, Obsidian import, resumable manifests, temporal re-import, mixed formats, truncation, per-file errors, and worker recovery (`043dd65c`, `8cab3c82`, `b21d859a`, `b07ac337`, `607af8b5`) | Focused regression: `python -m pytest tests/test_document_importer.py tests/test_document_import_cli.py tests/test_documents.py tests/test_obsidian_importer.py tests/test_obsidian_service.py tests/test_resource_import_atomicity.py -q`; executable journeys: `python -m eval.user_journeys --journey mixed_document_import`; [`docs/USER_JOURNEY_BENCHMARKS.md`](USER_JOURNEY_BENCHMARKS.md) | `PARTIAL`. Counts, digest lineage, parse failures, truncation, re-import deduplication, and rollback are measurable. The journey runner is local disposable-store evidence, not a large-vault throughput or customer import study. |
| Encrypted Cloud Sync bundles, source scope, tombstones, generation-aware repair, and current-canonical publication (`fd150ffe`, `a0c867b6`, `21113180`, `705e4639`, `5373e2c0`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_sync.py tests/test_sync_e2ee.py tests/test_sync_cli.py tests/test_sync_index_repair.py tests/test_sync_tombstones.py -q`; `python -m scripts.sync --help` | `LOCAL_GATE` for local encryption, scope, tombstone, and repair contracts. Relay, cloud authorization, restore/RPO/RTO, and multi-device production behavior remain unverified. |
| Writable SQLite WAL/FULL durability, balanced policy, abrupt-exit rollback, vector repair, secure erase, and cross-process writes (`18329d8c`, `d94c6f81`, `550602d7`, `c4964809`, `ea6ed79c`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_sqlite_durability.py tests/test_storage_concurrency_repair.py tests/test_conflict_repair.py tests/test_recall_recovery.py -q`; `python -m eval.repair_discovery`; [`docs/SQLITE_DURABILITY.md`](SQLITE_DURABILITY.md) | `LOCAL_GATE`. Disposable process-exit and database-full tests cover software behavior. Hardware power loss, filesystem corruption, and production restore objectives remain unverified. |
| Schema receipts, expected versions, typed conflicts, project workflows, paginated history, cursors, bounded read snapshots, and no repeated graph migrations (`4f775c62`, `8015713e`, `68dcc3a9`, `ea6ed79c`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_receipts.py tests/test_memory_revisions.py tests/test_history_scope.py tests/test_memory_browsing.py tests/test_browse_portable.py tests/test_live_read_snapshots.py tests/test_startup_transform_gates.py -q`; `python -m eval.user_journeys --journey index_repair --journey erase_restart` | `PARTIAL`. Correctness and restart behavior are locally exercisable. No multi-host cursor SLO or hosted workflow latency is claimed. |
| Request-scoped services, hosted context isolation, managed-processing approval and explicit operator opt-out (`12e6f136`, `8015713e`, `8a5181ff`, `550602d7`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_service_context.py tests/test_v2_service_binding.py tests/test_service_isolation.py tests/test_managed_processing_policy.py tests/test_cloud_session.py -q`; `python -m pytest tests/test_hosted_client.py tests/test_hosted_evidence.py -q` | `PARTIAL`. Local authorization and isolation contracts are covered. Real Workers, account identity, deployment, billing, and production tenant isolation require attended hosted evidence. |
| Device connect, hosted plan/trial state, license authority, and authenticated local browser sessions (`3258aeb9`, `139cbb47`, `18329d8c`, `4f775c62`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_agent_connect.py tests/test_device_connect.py tests/test_cloud_features.py tests/test_hosted_plan_resolution.py tests/test_local_auth_browser_session.py -q`; `python scripts/connect.py --help` | `PARTIAL`. Local identity, plan resolution, and fail-closed authorization are testable. Account identity, live entitlement, email, payment, and hosted deployment evidence remain attended gates. |
| Multi-agent session start/end identity, scope ownership, handoff continuity, and Command Code context hook (`139cbb47`, `d7d597ce`, `439aec4f`, `230573d0`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_session_idempotent.py tests/test_session_start_hook.py tests/test_install_cc_hook.py tests/test_workspace_isolation.py -q`; hook install/doctor commands are in [`docs/AGENT_CONNECT.md`](AGENT_CONNECT.md) | `PARTIAL`. Session and bounded `additionalContext` contracts are local. A coding-agent user-outcome run must still compare no-memory, full-history, lexical, dense, and hybrid arms on held-out tasks. |

### Interfaces, graph UX, and release-facing behavior

| Change and user outcome | Executable benchmark, metric, and evidence | Status and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Smart and Classic MCP surfaces, budget-bound recall context, subject-key forwarding, error envelopes, capability discovery, and content-free telemetry (`139cbb47`, `d7d597ce`, `550602d7`, `a74edeb4`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_smart_mcp_gateway.py tests/test_mcp_contract.py tests/test_mcp_server.py tests/test_mcp_annotation_idempotency.py -q`; `python scripts/export_mcp_contract.py` | `LOCAL_GATE`. Contract/schema and context-budget assertions exist. They do not establish tool-call success with independent clients or provider latency. |
| MCP stdio wire isolation, handshake-before-warmup, thread-safe startup, cached semantic model, stateless HTTP restarts, and Pi compatibility (`c9c9ca2f`, `607af8b5`, `6bd7e214`, `ea6ed79c`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_server.py tests/test_mcp_contract.py tests/test_start_dashboard.py`; `Set-Location integrations/pi; npm test` when the Node dependencies are installed; `Set-Location integrations/pi; npm run typecheck` for Pi typing | `PARTIAL`. Protocol and package tests are executable. Cross-client installed binaries, cold-start distributions, and production HTTP restarts remain separate release evidence. |
| Galaxy v6 through v13, physics controls, central/local orbit invariants, scene caps, Every-node renderer, accessibility, and cold graph-load protections (`4e327f51`, `81d342e5`, `5e61b07a`, `d7d597ce`, `e260794d`, `d5b819b2`, `51992d94`, `1.7.3`) | `python -m eval.graph_every_bench`; `npm test -- --runInBand` for the browser suite; `tests/test_graph_every_asset.py`, `tests/test_graph_scene_contract.py`, `tests/test_galaxy_gravity_slider.py`, `tests/test_galaxy_operating_bounds.py`; [`docs/GRAPH_PERFORMANCE.md`](GRAPH_PERFORMANCE.md) | `PARTIAL`. Scene correctness, WebGL2 fallback, accessibility, and bounded layouts are tested. A real 20k-node/200k-relation latency curve and user interaction study are not current public measurements. |
| Dashboard Ledger/Ask/Home/Explore, project workflows, history, independent Ask states, renderer lifecycle, and visible capability diagnostics (`1.4.5`, `1.6`, `4f775c62`, `ea6ed79c`) | Browser: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/ledger.spec.js tests/e2e/ask-home.spec.js tests/e2e/history-project.spec.js tests/e2e/memory-workflow.spec.js`; focused Python: `python -m pytest tests/test_dashboard_v2.py tests/test_service_graph.py tests/test_workflow_diagnostics.py -q` | `PARTIAL`. Browser behavior is covered when the attended browser and assets are installed. No production browser fleet or accessibility certification is claimed. |
| Prime-agent fleet wrapper, shared workspace, install path, and agent tool contract (`886ee210`) | `python -m pytest integrations/prime_agent/tests -q`; `python -m engraphis_prime_agent --help`; [`integrations/prime_agent/README.md`](../integrations/prime_agent/README.md) | `LOCAL_GATE`. Package and contract tests do not measure multi-agent task success, memory isolation at 100k scale, or external agent adoption. |
| Release identity, installed MCP/dashboard writes, restart and correction history, build/capability diagnostics, and source/distribution receipts (`4fe7f1c3`, `3ab83fbb`, `c4964809`, `ea6ed79c`, `ca790261`) | `python scripts/check_release_readiness.py --help`; `python scripts/verify_release_qualification.py --help`; `python scripts/smoke_installed_product.py --help`; `python -m pytest tests/test_release_evidence.py tests/test_release_qualification.py tests/test_product_release_readiness.py tests/test_installed_release_evidence.py -q`; `ruff check .`; `python scripts/check_commercial_manifest.py` | `PARTIAL`. Source and distribution checks are executable. Owner-signed qualification, protected release authority, external deployment, and real tenant writes are attended release gates, not implied by a green local suite. |
| Security and trust boundaries: path redaction, SQL parameterization, private state, pypdf floor, review/quarantine, and sync pointer validation (`2632c8a7`, `4e327f51`, `705e4639`, `9ea6965f`) | `python -m pytest tests/test_hotfix_security.py tests/test_http_security.py tests/test_secret_hygiene.py tests/test_private_state_boundaries.py tests/test_read_only_api.py tests/test_sync_e2ee.py tests/test_release_grounded_eval.py -q`; dependency audit in release workflow | `LOCAL_GATE` for source-level contracts and redaction. A third-party penetration test, malicious document corpus, and deployed relay threat assessment are not current evidence. |

## Release coverage index

This index ties the detailed rows to the user-facing release checkpoints in the requested interval.
Changelog entries remain the source of the complete prose; the rows above define the executable
metric and its boundary.

| Checkpoint | User-facing capabilities covered by the rows above |
|---|---|
| Screenshot baseline `a4c19eee` and shared ancestor `54c9985a` | Context-efficiency image, graph visual, Smart/Classic documentation, benchmark artifact provenance, LongMemEval and external-loader plumbing, local dashboard and MCP behavior. Historical tiny-fixture values remain non-promotional. |
| 1.2.0, 1.2.1, and 1.2.5 (`3258aeb9`, `fd150ffe`, `d1be5bc6`) | Hard context budget, valid-at/known-at/as-of temporal reads, code graph and memory entities, encrypted sync, adaptive context, productivity/context-economy metrics, external loader contracts, and evidence metadata. Covered by retrieval, context, sync, and external rows. |
| 1.3.0 and 1.4.5 (`17aa1d6f`, `139cbb47`) | Governed recall/consolidation, planned recall, Smart gateway, Pi surface, scoped writes, schema migrations, authorization and release boundaries. Covered by memory, storage, MCP, and hosted rows. |
| 1.5.0 and release-readiness follow-up (`18329d8c`, `3ab83fbb`) | Embedding provenance and rebuild safety, native exact KNN, poisoning/review gates, failure-atomic supersession, release evidence, installed smoke, and version diagnostics. Covered by retrieval, security, and release rows. |
| 1.6 and 1.6.1 (`043dd65c`, `2632c8a7`) | Universal documents and Obsidian, Galaxy v6, schema 14-16 source lineage and erasure, preview tokens, read-only inspection, SEC-001 path redaction, pypdf floor, and CI audit. Covered by documents, storage, graph, and security rows. |
| 1.7 through 1.7.3 (`4e327f51`, `d7d597ce`, `c9c9ca2f`, `550602d7`, `4f775c62`, `1.7.3`) | SEC-002, Galaxy v6 to v13, Every-node, context packing and routing, reranker option, reworded correction, narrow-arm controls, SessionStart and prime-agent integrations, MCP startup, scoped reliability, projects/history, hosted request isolation. Covered by all four capability sections. |
| 1.7.4 through the frozen main endpoint (`c4964809`, `ea6ed79c`, `ca790261`) | Durable SQLite policy, consolidation visibility batching, schema 18 receipts and revalidation, generation-aware sync repair, evidence-preserving context fallback, project/history/cursor workflows, Ask/Home/Explore states, strict coding and capacity infrastructure, Pi compatibility, and CodeQL permission fix. Covered by storage, state, coding, interface, and release rows. That production endpoint has no verified 100k claim. |

## Benchmark implementation after the frozen main endpoint

The local implementation commits add separate retrieved/packed evidence metrics, executable
corpus/oracles, isolated adapters, conservative reservations, resumable checkpoints, native
Codex OAuth-only readers, and source-bound serial local queues. They preserve production engine
defaults. The original pilot source is `7370e148d7793aeb632bc92494528376ec35267e`.
The continuation source `cc25ac5b59e3b5e04a79ee09b8d7454d01cb31c1` adds durable allocation
protection, preserves unknown calls and fixture exclusions, distinguishes ambiguous oracle
execution from task failure, and repairs the future v2 long-document contract. Its queue
watchdog also terminates Windows launcher descendants. These benchmark controls
are validated by the offline suite and focused regressions described in
[BENCHMARK_EXPANSION_RESULTS.md](BENCHMARK_EXPANSION_RESULTS.md). Experimental execution status
is maintained there; infrastructure completion does not imply completion of all experiment stages.

## Claims allowed now

The current evidence supports these bounded statements:

- The checked-in offline fixture artifact is checksum-bound and exposes its metric boundaries.
- Deterministic local evaluators and focused tests exercise temporal/scope recall, mutable-fact
  resolution, grounded abstention, code evidence, context packing, source imports, sync repair,
  MCP contracts, graph contracts, and release invariants.
- The implementation-authored coding corpus can verify disposable repository oracles and reader
  plumbing while preserving development, validation, and held-out family reservations.
- Full LoCoMo and LongMemEval retrieval runs separate retrieved evidence from what fits into the
  reader context. The completed LoCoMo k=20 comparison reports a measured opt-in tradeoff.
- The additional upstream adapters have source-pinned retrieval-only boundaries. The Mem2ActBench
  small-slice diagnostic and two MemoryAgentBench splits are complete; remaining local runs are queued and upstream scores remain absent.

The following remain open: equal-coverage coding-agent outcome results, independent human-authored
held-out tasks, competitor/model comparisons, 100k memories with multiple concurrent agents,
browser and hosted operational SLOs, hardware durability, official external answer/action scores,
and separately authorized model evaluation. [`docs/RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md`](RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md)
and [`docs/PAID_EVALUATION_PROPOSAL.md`](PAID_EVALUATION_PROPOSAL.md) retain the required gates,
cost proposal, and authority boundaries.

## Next evidence package

Before publishing a new number, freeze the exact source, corpus and authorship statement, reader
and model revisions, adapter/parser, token counter, prompts, budgets, baseline and competitor arms,
execution count, uncertainty method, and exclusions. Run the local protocol first, then obtain the
cost proposal and approvals for any provider-dependent arm. Publish only a redacted envelope with
checksums and the honest result status. Do not promote unit-test counts, screenshot values, replay
volume, index-only throughput, or structural capacity matrices into user-outcome claims.
