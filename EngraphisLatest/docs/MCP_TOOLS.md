# MCP tool reference

`engraphis-mcp` is the zero-configuration Smart MCP gateway. It initially exposes nine concise
tools: `engraphis_session`, `engraphis_recall_context`, `engraphis_remember`,
`engraphis_discover_actions`, `engraphis_execute_read`, `engraphis_execute_action`,
`engraphis_get_memory`, `engraphis_update_memory`, and `engraphis_conflict_review`. Agents use
the routine tools directly; for any advanced capability, they discover the best action and execute
the returned, version-bound capability ID. Discovery returns the precise schema and side-effect
class, and execution revalidates availability, scope, authorization, and arguments.

### Smart tool inventory

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `engraphis_session` | Starts or resumes a session, or ends it with a next-session handoff. |
| `engraphis_recall_context` | Returns one compact, bounded context packet for routine agent work. |
| `engraphis_remember` | Stores a routine durable memory with safe default provenance and deduplication. |
| `engraphis_discover_actions` | Returns exact schemas for a small set of matching advanced actions. |
| `engraphis_execute_read` | Executes only a discovered action that is read-only and idempotent. |
| `engraphis_execute_action` | Executes a discovered write, admin, or destructive-capable action. |
| `engraphis_get_memory` | Returns one governed memory record, excluding non-prompt-eligible content. |
| `engraphis_update_memory` | Edits memory metadata; content changes use the governed correction path. |
| `engraphis_conflict_review` | Lists pending, quarantined, or conflicting memories for review. |

The Smart gateway exposes these nine tools directly; advanced capabilities remain available through
discovery and the validated executors.

For a deliberate cross-agent handoff, pass the source ID as `session_id` when starting
`engraphis_session`, or as `resume_from_session_id` to `engraphis_start_session`. The source must
be an ended session owned by the same authenticated user in the exact resolved workspace and
repository. Missing, active, deleted, or unauthorized sources fail closed; the tool never
substitutes a recent handoff. The returned `bootstrap` is
bounded to 512 regex-counted content tokens, at most six open threads, and per-field character
limits. `handoff_source` labels the source start/end times in UTC. Sessions have no automatic
age expiry; those timestamps show age but do not guarantee freshness.

### Smart routine schemas are reduced by design

The two routine Smart tools deliberately accept smaller allow-lists than their Classic
namesakes; advanced controls are discoverable rather than routine:

| Smart tool | Accepted parameters |
|---|---|
| `engraphis_remember` | `content`, `workspace`, `repo`, `session_id`, `mtype`, `importance`, `subject_key`, `claim_kind`, optional source-bound `exact_value`/`exact_value_type`; safe provenance is fixed internally |
| `engraphis_recall_context` | `query`, `workspace`, `repo`, `session_id`, `k`, `token_budget`, `packing_mode`, `retrieval_recipe`, `format`, optional Jev controls `allow_remote`, `data_classification`; always compact, no `response_mode` |

`format="gist"` is a compatibility option for the same budgeted, cited evidence as
`full`. It preserves the same selected text and whitespace; it does not apply an
additional summary or promise extra token savings. Source IDs remain in `sources`.

Jev-assisted recall planning requires explicit BYOK and is opt-in. On the Smart context tool,
set `allow_remote=true` and
`data_classification="public"` or `"internal"`; that call both enables bounded route selection
and gives per-call consent for remote processing. The default stays deterministic and local.
Classic recall tools additionally require `planning="auto"` and `jev_assisted=true`.
The provider receives the query and bounded local routes, not recalled memory bodies. Jev cannot
change scope, time, type, or trust filters; uncertainty and failures retain deterministic route
order and appear in `planning_advisory`. Leaving the Jev controls at their defaults keeps local
deterministic behavior.
Managed access does not admit `query_planning`: it fails closed before credential refresh or
network requests, retaining deterministic route order with a visible fallback. Neither `managed`
nor `auto` silently switches to BYOK.


No user profile choice or tool switching is required. The dashboard `/mcp` endpoint and
`engraphis-mcp-http` use this Smart surface by default. `engraphis-mcp-classic` (or
`engraphis-mcp-http --classic`) preserves the 39 direct tools below for integrations that pin
their historical names and response shapes.

Hosts which already own chat history should use `POST /api/adaptive-context`, not an MCP action.
The gateway works in general MCP clients without native deferred tool search; clients that
explicitly support OpenAI's deferred `tool_search` can apply it as an optional host optimization.

### Workspace routing

Session starts accept an omitted workspace, resolving an explicit value, then the saved repo
mapping, then `default`. Routine remember and recall calls also inherit an omitted workspace
from an authorized supplied session before consulting the repo mapping. Local recall with no
workspace, repo, or session stays broad.
Explicit workspace/repo values that conflict with a supplied session are rejected; invalid or
unauthorized sessions never fall back. An explicit `workspace="default"` overrides a mapping.

Session and remember responses report the resolved workspace and `workspace_source` (`explicit`,
`project`, or `default`, plus `session` on inherited writes) so the agent can show its destination.
Pass the returned `session_id` on subsequent recall and write calls to retain that scope.
There is no implicit server-global current session, and changing the dashboard workspace
selector does not change agent arguments. See [workspace organization](WORKSPACE_ORGANIZATION.md)
for project setup, hook overrides, and organizing existing memories.

Saved project mappings live in the shared database, per authenticated caller or standalone
local context. The Classic `engraphis_list_workspaces`, `engraphis_get_workspace_routing`, and
`engraphis_set_workspace_routing` capabilities are available through Smart discovery and the
validated executors; saving a mapping still requires workspace access. Classic batch remember,
record-event, ingest, and proactive recall retain their explicit workspace contract: pass the
resolved destination returned by the session.

### Standalone semantic startup

On Windows, the standalone stdio and HTTP launchers import optional semantic dependencies
on the launcher thread before serving MCP requests. This prevents the first semantic tool
call from stalling during a native dependency import in a worker thread. Models are still
loaded lazily, and exact-backend validation retains its normal failure policy. Dependency
import diagnostics go to stderr so stdout stays reserved for the stdio protocol.

`ENGRAPHIS_MCP_PRELOAD_EMBEDDER=auto` enables this startup step on Windows when a semantic
embedding or reranking model is configured. Configured sources are validated before
optional imports, including the immutable revision policy. Set `0` to disable it or `1` to
enable it on other platforms. An unavailable optional dependency is left to the configured
backend fallback policy.

## Classic direct-tool inventory

The following inventory applies to the Classic compatibility server. Start with
`engraphis_recall_context` when an agent needs prompt-ready context, and use
`engraphis_remember` when it learns a durable fact.

Retrieval responses (`engraphis_recall`, `engraphis_recall_context`,
`engraphis_recall_grounded`, and `engraphis_answer`) always declare
`degraded_mode`, `semantic_support`, `embedding_mode`, and `vector_search_ready`. A `true`
degraded flag means the active backend is not a declared semantic embedder (the bundled
deterministic fallback is feature hashing with lexical overlap), the persistent vector space is
rebuilding or does not match the configured embedder, or the vector index failed for that
request. `vector_search_ready` is the authoritative vector-arm status. When
`semantic_support=false`, vector retrieval and semantic-cosine evidence are both disabled;
recall remains lexical/graph/code based and grounded answers use lexical support only. A
request-local index failure instead reports `vector_search_ready=false` while semantic support
can remain available for exact support scoring from the configured embedder and stored vectors.

Classic `engraphis_recall` and `engraphis_recall_context` also accept `jev_assisted` (default
`false`), `allow_remote` (default `false`), and `data_classification` (optional). Use the same
explicit remote-consent requirements described for the Smart context tool above.

Trust boundary: normal local-agent memory creation is prompt-visible immediately after validation;
it does not require owner approval. The default `agent` source covers `engraphis_remember`,
`engraphis_ingest`, and dashboard intent writes. External sources remain `pending` regardless of
a caller-supplied `trusted` label, and detector matches are `quarantined` immediately. Pending
and quarantined records are available only to explicit inspection workflows and never appear in
prompt-ready MCP recall or context, `engraphis_why`, or `engraphis_timeline`, nor can they feed
resolution, links, graph/code backfill, or derived prompt context. `include_untrusted=True` is
inspection-only and must never be copied into a model prompt.

MCP deliberately has no approval tool. Approval is only for external evidence: it
creates a fresh, audited `approved` successor while retaining the reviewed source and its
provenance. In the local product it is available only through the CSRF-bound dashboard review
action (with `ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN`) or the interactive TTY command
`python -m scripts.approve_memory MEM_ID --reason "..."`; the command rejects redirected input
and requires a typed confirmation. Local operators can use `engraphis-cli review list` and the
dry-run-first `engraphis-cli review approve` for scoped batches; quarantined records are excluded.
Hosted approval is an owner/admin action of the private hosted service. Direct in-process
`MemoryEngine` use is a trusted-code boundary for code that already has local database authority,
not a transport permission.

For the full memory trust model, automatic schema-11 classification, and operator recovery, see
the [memory write trust model](WRITE_REVIEW.md) and [recall recovery guide](RECALL_RECOVERY.md).

### Receipt-chain failure behavior

Receipt recording is deliberately fail-closed: if verification finds a fork, cycle, or
disconnected chain with no safe predecessor, the Store refuses to append and
`engraphis_verify_receipts` continues to report the invalid chain. The completed service
operation is not rolled back or reported as failed solely because its follow-up receipt could
not be recorded. Its JSON result contains `"receipt": null` and a content-free
`"receipt_warning":{"code":"receipt_chain_integrity_failure",...}` marker. Repair or restore
the receipt chain before treating subsequent receipt continuity as audit evidence.

Emitted recall receipts include the normalized `packing_mode` (`legacy` or `coverage`)
alongside the retrieval recipe and effective depth. Historical receipts remain valid;
an omitted mode means it was not recorded, and is not inferred from current defaults.

| Category | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Write | `engraphis_remember` | Stores a fact and resolves it as a new memory, reinforcement, safe supersession, or related memory. |
| Write | `engraphis_remember_many` | Stores a fan-out batch of facts in one transaction: within-batch dedup/supersession, plus evidence-labeled edges between siblings sharing a `subject_key` or declared `evidence_source`. |
| Write | `engraphis_record_event` | Appends one raw occurrence to the event ledger; event rows are not recalled, deduplicated, reinforced, or consolidated as memories. |
| Write | `engraphis_link` | Connects two related memories. |
| Write | `engraphis_ingest` | Applies the configured extractor (`chunk`, `llm`, or `llm_structured`). With `none`, it stores one verbatim memory. |
| Write | `engraphis_ingest_postgres_schema` | Stores a PostgreSQL schema snapshot and typed graph. The DSN is never stored. |
| Write | `engraphis_consolidate` | Runs a dry-run or live consolidation sweep. A live call can write resolved facts and receipts. |
| Stateful read | `engraphis_recall_context` | Returns hard-budget context, compact sources, token usage, and optional diagnostics. Recommended for agent prompts. Compact-only: it never accepts `response_mode` and never returns full memory bodies. |
| Stateful read | `engraphis_recall` | Runs hybrid vector, lexical, and graph recall. It attempts a receipt without strengthening weak matches. |
| Stateful read | `engraphis_recall_grounded` | Returns a cited answer or abstains when the evidence is too weak. It attempts a receipt and reinforces cited memories. |
| Stateful read | `engraphis_answer` | Backward-compatible alias for `engraphis_recall_grounded`. |
| Pure read | `engraphis_recall_proactive` | Returns high-signal, queryless context and a last-session handoff. It does not reinforce or record a receipt. |
| Stateful read | `engraphis_proactive_context` | Builds task-aware cited context and attempts a receipt without reinforcement. |
| Read | `engraphis_why` | Returns the current answer and the memories it superseded. |
| Read | `engraphis_timeline` | Returns complete bi-temporal history, oldest first. |
| Code | `engraphis_index_repo` | Incrementally parses a repository into the code and memory graph. Each run attempts a receipt. |
| Code | `engraphis_search_code` | Finds symbols, callers, and linked memories. |
| Code | `engraphis_code_path` | Finds a path across definitions, calls, imports, and memories. |
| Code | `engraphis_code_impact` | Ranks changed-file impact using dependents, communities, memories, and hotspots. |
| Code | `engraphis_export_code_graph` | Exports graph JSON, Markdown, and HTML. |
| Code | `engraphis_link_symbol` | Manually links a code symbol to a memory (idempotent). |
| Audit | `engraphis_receipts` | Lists content-free hashed operation receipts. |
| Audit | `engraphis_context_savings` | Reports receipt-backed estimated context tokens saved across all visible workspaces by default, or one workspace when supplied; optional `from_ts`, `to_ts`, and `release_version` filters are supported. This is estimated prompt-context reduction, not provider billing. |
| Audit | `engraphis_verify_receipts` | Verifies the receipt chain, local tail anchor, and an optional saved head/count. |
| Audit | `engraphis_export_receipts` | Exports a shareable receipt-only audit bundle. |
| Governance | `engraphis_retire` | Retires a memory by closing its validity window. It does not delete history. |
| Governance | `engraphis_secure_erase` | Irreversibly removes one leaked memory and local indexes; reports local-backup and external-copy limitations. |
| Compatibility | `engraphis_forget` | Deprecated alias for `engraphis_retire`; preserves the legacy response shape. |
| Governance | `engraphis_pin` | Prevents future automatic decay or pruning. |
| Governance | `engraphis_correct` | Replaces memory content without losing the previous version. Changed content clears the old literal binding; `exact_value`, `exact_value_type`, and optional `exact_value_span` explicitly bind a replacement, or `clear_exact_value=true` removes it. Governed provenance remains pending unless separately approved. |
| Governance | `engraphis_promote` | Widens an explicitly approved memory's scope while preserving and linking its narrower history. |
| Session | `engraphis_start_session` | Starts a work session. Exact retries are safe; `force_new=true` creates another session. |
| Workspace | `engraphis_list_workspaces` | Lists visible workspaces for choosing a destination. |
| Workspace | `engraphis_get_workspace_routing` | Returns the current caller's saved destination for an exact `repo` name. |
| Workspace | `engraphis_set_workspace_routing` | Saves or removes a repo-to-workspace mapping; takes `workspace`, `repo`, and `enabled` (default `true`). |
| Session | `engraphis_end_session` | Closes a work session with a summary and open threads. |
| Operations | `engraphis_stats` | Returns memory counts for health checks. |
| Operations | `engraphis_check_update` | Refreshes the release cache and reports whether a newer version is available. Update checks are OFF unless `ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_CHECK` is set to an affirmative value; `=0` keeps them off. |
| Decision | `engraphis_decide` | Advisory typed decisions with local fallback. Remote Jev requires an explicit backend and per-call `allow_remote=true`; missing, malformed, and uncertain answers stay visible. Smart discovery routes it through `engraphis_execute_action` because a remote call may consume allowance. |

Classic `engraphis_start_session` accepts optional `resume_from_session_id` for the same explicit,
same-owner, exact-workspace/repository handoff. Its `handoff_usage` reports the deterministic output
limit; it is context accounting and does not measure provider billing or task-time savings.

Decision inputs must be nonblank for the selected kind: `guard_command` needs `state`;
`classify_contradiction` needs `state` and `existing_content`; `verify_support` needs `state`
and `query`; `verify_completion` needs `state` and `goal`, with optional `recent_actions`.
`custom` accepts either `state` or `question`. Missing required input returns `invalid_request`
before backend lookup, with unknown/null conclusions and no remote allowance consumed.
Managed access admits only the four concrete workflows above with their fixed questions and
required context. A purpose label cannot authorize arbitrary question schemas. Managed `custom`
requests return `managed_operation_unsupported` without a credential refresh or network request;
custom remote questions require explicit BYOK. Local custom fallback remains available.
Managed Jev is currently `not_yet_available` pending release acceptance and
service-capacity qualification; client configuration does not enable it. After
enablement, every legitimate Pro user and each eligible Team named seat, including paid
viewers, with an active paid, trial, or test entitlement receives managed Jev at no
additional customer charge and without a personal provider key.

Each individual receives all three independent rolling limits: **100 evaluated questions per rolling hour, 1,000 per rolling five hours, and 2,000 per rolling 24 hours**. Usage is per
person, not pooled across a Team and not monthly. Each evaluated question counts once;
if a batch is evaluated, every question counts. A `guard_command` review evaluates two
questions, and each other supported workflow evaluates one. Admitted attempts that fail
or are interrupted remain counted. No overage is charged. The account portal reports
that member's remaining usage across all three windows; usage returns as earlier
questions leave each rolling window.

The existing production fleet guard remains 100 questions per day across the service. It
conflicts with the per-person rolling caps and may pause or reject requests earlier, so
resolve capacity and the fleet guard before launch. No latency, accuracy, or cost-saving
guarantee is established by configuration or a successful health check.

Managed access admits only `guard_command`, `classify_contradiction`, `verify_support`,
and `verify_completion`, with fixed question schemas and required context. Managed
`custom` questions and `query_planning` fail closed before credential refresh or network
requests; explicit BYOK and local custom heuristics remain separate choices.

Admitted errors remain counted. Managed transport callers can preserve an explicit `request_key`
for a retry; duplicate admitted keys return 409 without a second provider call or usage increment.
No answer is stored for replay, and no automatic retry occurs. The MCP tool does not expose a
`request_key` parameter.

The direct Classic `engraphis_decide` tool permits authorized viewers and remains advisory.
It does not grant memory writes or administration. Smart discovery still classifies the action
as stateful because it can consume allowance, so `engraphis_execute_action` retains its admin
requirement. The private hosted Team tool catalog is unchanged. Managed service release
acceptance, service capacity, and live quality evaluation remain required.
Command decisions always return `allow_auto=false` and `escalate_to_user=true`, including
successful remote answers. Provider probability and category are advice, not shell authorization.
Local command labels are coarse: only one simple inspection command, without chaining, pipes,
substitution or file redirection, is `read_only`. Recognized destructive, history-rewriting,
exfiltrating or credential-file commands are `destructive_or_leak`; anything else, including a
command too long to screen completely, is `state_change`.

The classic recall, grounded, and answer tools (`engraphis_recall`,
`engraphis_recall_grounded`, and the `engraphis_answer` alias) accept `planning="off"|"auto"`,
optional `mtype_limits` such as `{"working": 1, "semantic": 3}`, and optional
`max_response_tokens` from `2` through `1000000`. `response_mode="full"` retains complete
memory/citation bodies; `"compact"` omits those duplicate bodies. If the serialized response
cap cannot hold the packed context, it removes that context and its exact-binding metadata
together while preserving source/citation references when they fit. `engraphis_recall_context`
is always compact and does not accept `response_mode`; it shares the same
`max_response_tokens` floor. Responses include a stable `context_revision`. Planner
details, per-query rankings, type-limit drops, and fallback reasons are returned only when
`diagnostics=true`. Type limits are post-rank maxima and can intentionally return fewer than `k`;
they do not raise a memory type's relevance. Every planned query remains inside the caller's scope,
temporal, trust, and prompt-eligibility filters, and grounded recall still measures support against
the original query.

Compact service and REST recall candidate rows contain identities and scores, without
`exact_value`. Literal bindings appear only in `packed_sources` for admitted evidence;
`engraphis_recall_context` exposes these admitted bindings in `sources`. A candidate's presence
alone does not establish that its complete source was included in the returned context.
An exact binding requires the complete memory source, with boundary whitespace trimming
permitted only outside the bound value. This retains conditions without inferring their
meaning or authorizing an action. Partial legacy excerpts remain ordinary context without
binding metadata; coverage withholds bound groups that cannot fit.

For parameter details and return shapes, see the tool descriptions exposed by the MCP server. The
[agent connection guide](AGENT_CONNECT.md) explains local and hosted connections, and the
[Kilo Code guide](KILO_CODE_INTEGRATION.md) shows a complete editor integration.

## Versioned integration contract

[The generated MCP contract](MCP_CONTRACT.json) exports the registered Smart and
Classic input schemas, descriptions and annotations with a content digest.
Regenerate it with `python scripts/export_mcp_contract.py`; CI verifies the JSON
and the generated Pi/Prime Agent schemas with `--check` and the contract tests.
Host-specific session agent names and configured scope defaults are supplied by
integration adapters. Prime Agent also retains strict unknown-field validation
and documented action aliases and enum checks. Runtime authorization is unchanged.
