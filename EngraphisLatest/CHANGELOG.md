## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.9] - 2026-09-29

- Classify local `engraphis_decide` command advice conservatively. Chained, piped,
  substituted or redirected commands, and options that run programs or write files
  (`rg --pre`, `pytest --basetemp`), are never labeled read-only. Recursive deletes in any
  flag order, raw device writes, history-rewriting or work-discarding Git operations, SQL
  and infrastructure teardown, downloaded-script execution, exfiltrating pipes and uploads,
  and well-known credential files are labeled destructive or leaking. Screening is bounded
  so adversarial input stays cheap. Repeated Git options and quoted arguments use disjoint
  matching alternatives to prevent exponential backtracking when no destructive command follows.
- Match whole words, ignore zero counts and treat negated success as failure in local
  completion checks; contrasts ("not only passed") and negated failures ("did not fail") are
  not failures. Local support and contradiction checks compare content words rather than
  shared stopwords, and support keeps one-character terms such as "C". Supersession requires
  a shared subject plus a replacement cue the existing fact lacks, or a negation (including
  "cannot") whose ruled-out clause the other fact asserts ("does not use port 80" opposes
  "uses port 80", not "uses port 443"); between terse facts one shared word is the subject,
  so "No SQLite" opposes "Use SQLite". Reinforcement requires matching cues and one fact
  containing the other's content words, so conflicting values defer. Any number of Git global
  options and clustered short flags no longer bypass destructive-command checks, and
  path-specific or pathspec-file checkouts, worktree restores and force-created branch resets
  count as discarding work. Credential paths match either path separator.
- Fixed Anthropic connections for current Claude models. Opus 4.7 and later, Sonnet 5 and
  later, and Fable no longer receive `temperature`, which they reject. Replies are read from
  text blocks, so a leading thinking block no longer fails with "Unexpected Anthropic response
  format". Models that think by default get `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_EFFORT` (default `medium`) and at
  least 4096 output tokens so reasoning cannot crowd out the reply.
- Replaced the retired `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` Anthropic default in the dashboard picker,
  the API defaults, `.env.example`, and the provider guide with `claude-sonnet-5-5`.
- Documented how to back the experimental Jev decision adapter with Claude: pin an exact model
  id, keep fallback disabled, and avoid sampling parameters and forced tool choice.
- Recognized `claude-mythos-preview` and other unversioned Fable/Mythos ids, so they no longer
  receive `temperature` (an HTTP 400) and get the thinking-model output headroom.
- A remote `verify_completion` probability between the certainty bound and the 0.85 completion
  bar is now `uncertain` with a null `is_complete`, instead of a decisive failure.
- Local completion checks recognize `N passing` (Mocha/Jest style), `not passing`, `0 passing`
  and `errors: none`.
- Preserve individual negation targets in local contradiction advice, so a shared prohibition
  cannot hide a separate conflict; different explicit subjects defer. Forced Git branch resets
  and clustered deletion flags are destructive advice, and explicit Git diff/textconv or
  ripgrep hostname helpers are never labeled read-only.

- Added the saved-session managed Jev transport and Classic/Smart MCP decision route
  for Pro and Team, with explicit consent and current hosted entitlement checks.
  Cloud activation remains a separate rollout requirement; see the upgrade and
  qualification instructions in `docs/RELEASE_1_7_9.md`.
- Retire consumed refresh credentials when a successful response has an invalid
  token subject, and keep empty graph-layer selections separate from all-layer cache entries.

- Updated the Pi extension's locked `fast-uri` to 3.1.8, `ip-address` to 10.7.2 and
  `brace-expansion` to 5.0.12. CI repairs the Pi test host's embedded vulnerable leaf with
  that exact pin, verifies the installed version, and audits both the full dependency lock
  and installed tree. Pi checks use bash on Windows, so every install, build, test and audit
  failure stops the job.
- Provide a valid offline decision example in Smart MCP action discovery.
- Reject coerced numeric/string remote consent before Classic MCP can select a Jev backend.
- Retain global entities referenced by workspace edges during secure erasure,
  while preserving exact-workspace incidence checks for workspace-owned entities.
- Preserve graph cache isolation, pause intent through WebGL context loss, and
  theme-correct exported backgrounds.
- Scope graph incidence queries to candidate entities and retain shared legacy
  entities during secure erasure.
- Require the credential-bound control origin before selecting managed Jev.
- Bound chunked response trailers while retaining strict deadline completion checks.
- Keep relocation policy behind domain storage operations and 500-memory moves
  within the legacy SQLite variable limit.
- Updated the Pi test host to 0.87.1 to include the patched WebSocket client, and
  extended the Pi dependency audit to cover its development dependencies.
- Updated the Pi extension's locked `ip-address` dependency to 10.5.1, fixing
  IPv6 link-local and NAT64 classification advisories without changing its dependency ranges.
- Kept managed Jev available when an unrelated compute endpoint cannot resolve,
  while retaining destination validation for requests that use compute.
- Bounded Jev key input and serialized configuration before publication, preserving
  existing setup on rejection. Invalid decision kinds now defer without a fabricated
  selection in direct, Classic, and Smart calls.
- Preserved owner-only configuration checks when updating an existing Jev key, and
  restored support for legacy injected decision clients while retaining per-call consent
  and a single provider invocation.
- Save fully received Cloud credential rotations before reporting an expired request
  deadline, while rejecting truncated bodies and watchdog-interrupted responses.
- Recognize complete chunked refresh responses at the watchdog boundary without
  accepting a missing or truncated trailer terminator.
- Rebuild FastMCP settings eagerly to avoid a forward-reference warning on newer SDKs.
- Preserve CSS gradient tiles, screen blending and reduced-motion opacity in graph PNGs,
  including fractional display scaling; synchronize graph cache metadata across threads.
- Refreshed public offline fixtures and source bindings in immutable v128 evidence for the
  final 1.7.9 candidate; historical artifacts remain unchanged.
- Campaign adapter capabilities and metrics now report the loaded Engraphis runtime version.

- Added saved project-to-workspace routing and connection instructions so agents can use the
  user's selected workspace. Routine MCP calls inherit an omitted workspace from an authorized
  session or repo mapping, report the resolved destination, and reject session mismatches.
- Command Code's SessionStart hook now uses the nearest Git root's repo name, honors saved
  workspace mappings unless explicitly overridden, and labels recalled context with the
  server's resolved workspace. Save a mapping to keep recalling memories stored under the
  earlier folder-named workspace default.
- Added a previewed selective move workflow for organizing mixed workspaces while retaining
  source history and enforcing move eligibility and workspace access.
- Hardened the experimental Cloud decision client with validated destinations,
  redirect refusal, bounded responses, strict decision parsing, and read-only
  result interfaces. Loopback endpoints bypass proxies and reject external DNS
  destinations. Managed availability and performance remain unverified.
- Fixed the spacetime overlay's final paused frame being skipped by paint throttling.
- Enforced a Cloud request deadline across connection retries, TLS, request sends,
  proxy handshakes, slow headers, and chunk framing. Preserved HTTP 413 for streamed oversized read-only
  requests across parser versions.
- Prevented retained-release waiver repairs from replacing a newer GitHub Latest
  release, with a shared publication queue to serialize GitHub release writes.
- Reran the public offline fixtures into immutable v88 evidence and refreshed its
  source bindings, documentation, and charts.

## [1.7.8] - 2026-09-27

- Improved graph rendering and overlay scheduling, preserved saved Compact and custom
  slider preferences, and corrected orbit radii, focus validation, and worker force limits.
- Hardened Windows MCP startup by preloading configured embedding and reranking
  dependencies before background warmup, while retaining exact-backend requirements,
  source-integrity validation, and an explicit preload opt-out.
- Added an experimental, explicitly authorized Jev decision adapter with fail-closed
  response validation; it does not write memories or participate in grounded recall.
- Corrected API capacity and evidence projections and refreshed immutable offline
  evidence and charts against the release source. Offline fixtures do not establish
  live hosted-service or full-product qualification.
- Updated the optional Codex SDK to 0.155.1 and pinned CodeQL actions to 4.38.2.

## [1.7.7] - 2026-09-23

- Cloud Sync shows local encryption-key and dependency readiness before enabling Sync now,
  guides first-device key setup, and identifies shared workspaces eligible for upload.
  Partial workspace rounds remain visibly incomplete.
- Pro Analytics resumes the exact submitted job across workspace switches and displays
  its completed result without submitting a duplicate snapshot or run.
- Release auditing checks an unpublished wheel with OSV and its installed published
  dependencies with PyPI. Qualification inputs now use protected Actions secrets so
  variable-backed step logs cannot disclose the signed receipt. Owner-signed,
  exact-artifact full-product qualification remains required before publication.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-09-23

- Hardened Railway container startup persistence and readiness: entrypoint revalidates
  trusted paths before ownership changes, enforces private 0700 permissions, preserves
  ownership of external container state directories, rejects unsafe ownership markers
  and hard-linked privileged startup inputs, and initializes private state for rootless
  container execution.
- Improved agent-memory evidence and benchmark integrity: expanded evaluation harness,
  local capacity campaign runners, campaign oracles and candidate compatibility, exact
  value correction surfaces, compact recall HTTP endpoints, and comprehensive evidence
  verification contracts.
- Upgraded tree-sitter-language-pack to 1.20.0, openai-codex to 0.154.0, and pyright to 1.1.414.
- Receipt-chain structural corruption remains fail-closed at the Store boundary without
  bricking a completed service operation: affected responses now carry a content-free
  `receipt_warning`, and graph/import workers preserve their completed state.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-09-13

- Writable SQLite files now default to WAL plus FULL synchronization, with an explicit
  balanced option and effective-policy diagnostics. Disposable fault tests cover abrupt
  process exit and database-full rollback; hardware power loss remains unverified.
- Consolidation recall batches evidence-visibility checks within the Store's 500-ID bound,
  preserving citations for larger digests under scope and temporal filters.
- Pi resolves patched Hono while retaining MCP SDK compatibility below version 2.
- Release verification exercises installed MCP and dashboard writes, restarts, corrections
  and history on Windows, macOS and Linux. Product-readiness receipts bind exact components,
  underlying evidence and independent release/leadership decisions.
- Normal and repair publication require owner-signed qualification of the exact source,
  distributions and private ledger. Protected authority configuration is a release prerequisite;
  no signing authority or approval is created by installing this package.
- Performance diagnostics accept pinned local models, real files and exact vector backends,
  and expose opt-in recall phase timings. Planner promotion now has an explicit failing CLI
  gate when its evaluation booleans are unmet; ranking defaults are unchanged.
- Added schema 18 content-free command receipts and cross-process source revalidation for
  corrections, approvals, promotions and merges. Combined memory revisions have expected
  versions, operation IDs, atomic metadata/history, and typed conflicts.
- Sync publication uses current canonical state and generation-aware repair; delayed work
  cannot restore erased vectors. Native-index failures roll back canonical changes.
- Context retains distinct scoped evidence; synthesis falls back when complete source
  units, titles, values or conditions are lost. Answer coverage defaults to unknown.
- Added project-aware memory workflows and paginated record history.
- Library cursors survive unrelated activity and work across processes. File-backed
  browsing uses bounded live read snapshots; completed graph migrations are not
  repeated at ordinary startup.
- Ask separates answer/preview retries, cancellation and answer coverage. Home uses
  actionable review state; Explore pauses hidden views through existing renderers.
- Added content-free diagnostics and build/capability information, strict coding
  acceptance validation and a file-backed independent-process capacity harness.
  These provide measurement infrastructure, not verified 100k capacity claims.
- MCP stdio startup accepts the JSON-RPC handshake before optional semantic-model
  warmup, while retaining deterministic fallback and exact-backend policy.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Preserved Galaxy carrier lane and kinematic orbit invariants through central-field slider
  changes, including the global and core cached radii used by the next fixed slice.
- Refreshed the retained local orbital speed budget when the effective local-gravity control
  changes, preventing a stale phase cache from masking the slider.
- Kept high-density Galaxy layouts inside the strict speed cap while maintaining authored
  carrier and nested local orbit phase.
- Bounded the zero central-gravity radius response so finite far-field envelopes cannot leave
  oversized kinematic carrier caches behind, and counted fallback speed-cap activations.
- Bumped the deterministic Galaxy scene algorithm identity to `galaxy-v13-responsive-compact-orbits`
  so cached layouts cannot be confused with the revised placement contract.

### Tests

- Added deterministic regressions for central-field cache scaling and local-gravity phase
  invalidation, alongside the existing 500-body and browser accessibility coverage.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Added `idx_vector_index_repairs_queue` composite index on `(identity, generation, memory_id)`
  in `engraphis/core/schema.py` to prevent table scans during external vector repair queue dequeue.
- Added explicit operator opt-out verification with `403 Forbidden` (`processing_operator_disabled`)
  for authenticated direct POST requests to `/managed-processing` in `engraphis/routes/v2_api.py`.
- Added `_only_environment_title_order_changed` in `engraphis/core/resolve.py` ensuring unkeyed
  facts with permuted environment titles resolve to `NOOP` rather than false conflicts.
- Added comprehensive reliability regression coverage covering storage concurrency, vector index
  repair indexing, and managed processing policy enforcement.

### Fixed

- Preserved `[all]` extras fallback for legacy editable installations in `scripts/update.py`
  when no installation profile is recorded.
- Fixed external vector index hydration on physical index recreation and rebuilds.
- Fixed docstring dedenting and contract normalization across Python 3.9 through 3.14.

### Changed

- Bumped `tree-sitter-language-pack` to 1.16.1.
- Updated `codeql-action`, `anchore/scan-action`, and `anchore/sbom-action` GitHub Actions dependencies.

### Reliability and privacy

- Preserve distinct context claims, qualified sentences and complete units under tight budgets;
  measure false NOOP outcomes through real write sequences.
- Preserve separate sources during packing and keep MCP gist responses within the canonical
  context budget. Response caps retain or omit complete context and report accurate usage.
- Canonical temporal browsing, server-side Library filtering/pagination, independent Ask states,
  actionable setup diagnostics and retained installation capabilities.
- Cross-process write resolution and schema 17 durable vector-index repair, with canonical
  fallback and bounded NumPy scans. Public engine entrypoints remain compatible.
- Commit native batch indexing with canonical memory state and roll back both on failure.
  Retain the established 12,000-memory graph window pending quality evidence for a smaller one.
- Explicit workspace managed-processing approval; missing legacy policy pauses readable uploads.
  Requires the compatible cloud migration before rollout. Encrypted sync remains separate.
- Generated Smart/Classic MCP contract and integration inputs; Pro three-day and Team ten-day
  trial copy aligned with cloud authority. Real browser and Workers evidence remains distinct
  from production verification. See `docs/RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md`.
- Isolate the manual graph diagnostic on an available local port with a private in-memory
  server; fail before contacting an existing service when the requested port is occupied.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Isolated stdio transport wire in `engraphis.mcp_server`: redirected `sys.stdout`
  to `sys.stderr` while preserving the raw binary stream for JSON-RPC wire
  communication, preventing external library stdout chatter (e.g. PyTorch,
  Hugging Face, tqdm) from corrupting the wire and triggering `write EOF` stream
  disconnection errors in Node.js harnesses (Command Code, Cursor, Claude Code, Cline).
- Added thread-safe singleton initialization with `threading.Lock()` to
  `engraphis.mcp_server.service()`.
- Added non-blocking background daemon warmup (`_start_background_warmup()`) in
  `engraphis.mcp_server` to pre-warm the database and embedder, eliminating
  cold-start latency and timeout disconnects on the first MCP tool call. Can be
  bypassed with `ENGRAPHIS_MCP_WARMUP=0`.
- Added cache-first fast path (`local_files_only=True`) in
  `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` (`engraphis/backends/embedder_st.py`), allowing
  locally cached models to initialize in ~0.3s without network calls or remote
  registry checks.
- Added embedder forward-pass diagnostic check to `engraphis-init --check` and
  added `engraphis-init --prefetch` command to download and cache model weights
  during setup.

## [1.7] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Smart MCP `engraphis_recall_context` default `k` raised 8 -> 50 so the token-budget
  packer binds on realistic stores by default. Measured at budget=1024 against a
  49-fact store: 100% labelled-relevance retention and ~50% of the store withheld
  (savings_ratio 0.0 -> 0.4975) with no caller-side arguments. The packer is the
  existing 1.6 contract; the change just makes it the default fast path.
- Smart MCP `engraphis_remember` now accepts and forwards `subject_key` and
  `claim_kind` to the classic tool, so the documented safe-supersession
  mechanism is reachable through MCP.
- A new integration at `integrations/commandcode/session_start_hook.py` (with
  `scripts/install_cc_hook.py` for idempotent user-scope install/uninstall) wires
  durable-memory recall into Command Code's SessionStart lifecycle: each new
  session's first turn receives bounded relevant context as `additionalContext`.
  Fail-open and silent on any error. Override workspace via
  `ENGRAPHIS_HOOK_WORKSPACE`; override the MCP URL via `ENGRAPHIS_MCP_URL`.
- Cross-encoder reranker (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) is now
  reachable as an opt-in config knob (`rerank_model=` on `MemoryEngine.create`
  / `ENGRAPHIS_RERANK_MODEL`). Evaluated offline on the bundled retrieval gates
  (sample.jsonl, codemem.jsonl, k=5): hit@5 stays at 1.0 with zero per-question
  regressions, MRR@5 lifts 0.889 -> 0.944 (sample) and 0.962 -> 0.981 (codemem),
  with ~15 ms per query added. Not the default; set the value in the trusted
  config file (`~/.engraphis/config.env` on the operator account, or as a
  process environment variable); Engraphis deliberately does not read the
  CWD `.env`, so editing `./.env` and restarting leaves the identity
  reranker active. Restart the MCP server and dashboard after the change.

### Changed

- The reworded-correction detector in `core/resolve.py` now supersedes reworded
  corrections without a stable `subject_key` when the aligned token diff shows
  a same-attribute value change (e.g. "the timeout is 30 seconds" -> "we raised
  the timeout to 90 seconds"). The strong-evidence branch and the rewrite_gate
  branch both require a change marker (e.g. "now", "raised") to be accompanied
  by a value_swap on the same shared subject, so a bare "now" can never retire
  a fact it merely shares surface nouns with. Vetoes preserve coexisting
  distinct facts: clashing environment qualifiers (staging vs production,
  folded through `prod`/`production` and `dev`/`development` aliases so a
  legitimate correction across short forms does not get vetoed),
  named mixed-case identifier swaps (ProviderA -> ProviderB), and clean
  noun-for-noun replacements (REST -> GraphQL docs). Measured on the
  reproducible corpus shipped at
  `eval/datasets/resolver_reworded_corrections.jsonl` (44 pairs, 38
  positives + 6 negatives); reproduce locally with
  `python -m eval.resolver_reworded_corrections` or
  `python -m eval.resolver_reworded_corrections --strict` in CI.
- The `temporal_splice` flag passed from `core/engine.py` to `resolve()` is
  now narrowed to the bi-temporal backfill case (a deliberate `valid_at`
  AND a `subject_key`), instead of any `valid_at`-pinned write. Scheduled
  future writes stay on the present-time veto contract.

### Fixed

- The Smart MCP gateway `engraphis_remember` now forwards `subject_key` and
  `claim_kind` end to end, matching the **Added** entry above.

### Operational

- The new `engraphis_recall_context` tool emits one `INFO` log per call with
  workspace, k, budget, packed/omitted counts, and the call's measured ms.
  Operators get visibility without changing the on-the-wire contract.
  The standalone \engraphis-mcp-http\ launcher only configures the root logger when
  \ENGRAPHIS_MCP_LOG\ is set to a truthy value (\ / \	rue\ / \yes\ / \info\ /
  \on\); the default stays silent so the CLI keeps its quiet profile.

- The graph's "Show all nodes" toggle is replaced by a dedicated **Every node** layout built
  on a new ultra-performance engine (`engraphis-graph-every.js` +
  `engraphis-graph-every-worker.js`, WebGL2-only): all geometry is uploaded once and camera
  moves touch only uniforms, so pan/zoom frame cost is independent of node count up to the
  20,000-node / 200,000-relation ceilings. Zoomed-out scenes read as an additive glow
  density map; edges reveal progressively by weight with gold bridges; community districts
  paint as tinted region hulls with hub-derived labels; hovering or highlighting a node dims
  everything outside its neighbourhood, marks its relations with directional arrows and
  relation names, and shows a callout card with category, connection count, and strongest
  connections. Includes two-pointer pinch zoom, keyboard browsing (arrows/+/-/F/Escape),
  a screen-reader live region for scene and hover announcements, and deterministic worker
  layouts that stream settling passes (measured: ~320 ms settle at 2k nodes, ~1.2 s at 20k).
  Entering Every-node shows every entity regardless of overview filters; leaving restores
  the person's filters.

### Changed

- Direct black-hole children now receive compact, deterministic orbital lanes near the black
  hole instead of inheriting the farthest authored radius. Each lane keeps phase and painted
  clearance, while community-child planets remain in their local moving frame; oversized Galaxy
  scenes seed the same lanes before their kinematic clock starts.
- Complete Galaxy packing now uses a 4% painted-envelope clearance instead of a blanket 15%
  radial allowance, keeping solar-system carriers materially denser around the black-hole
  interior while preserving non-overlap.
- Explicit `orbits` links from the black hole now promote community anchors and their declared
  stellar children into the central orbital carrier group, so the Orbital speed control moves
  the connected nodes in both live and oversized Galaxy paths.
- Every Galaxy body now receives both motion frames: its top-level system carrier orbits the
  black hole, while the body follows its immediate star/planet carrier with cached local phase;
  legacy community metadata and nested moons use the same hierarchy without phase rewinds.
- Any direct black-hole edge now promotes its endpoint into the central orbital carrier group;
  relation labels no longer suppress direct star/system motion.
- Galaxy physics ticks now explicitly invalidate the canvas camera, so advancing orbital
  coordinates repaints visibly even when force-graph's automatic redraw loop is paused.
- Complete graph analysis now scans up to 40,000 entity rows and 200,000 raw relationships,
  while the explicit all-node renderer retains its 20,000-node, 200,000-link refusal ceiling.
  Live-render safety thresholds remain unchanged so oversized scenes stay on the static path.
- Show all nodes now keeps the complete sidebar live: deterministic worker layouts respond to
  repel, link-distance, gravity, and advanced force controls; minimum relations, unlinked nodes,
  focus depth, relation layers, ghosts, and auto-collapse filter the LOD scene without a reload.
  Capped directional relation flow, reduced-motion fallbacks, visible-count status, exact-repository
  code overlays, and a 200,000-link worker guard complete the release safety contract.

- Galaxy admission now uses a tighter default carrier gap and calibrated orbital slack, keeping
  more complete solar systems in the black-hole interior without sacrificing painted clearance.

- Galaxy mode now exposes normalized controls for gravitational constant, compact black-hole
  mass, independent local-solar gravity, space friction, edge-spring stiffness, and orbit
  pause/play. The fixed-step Velocity Verlet field superposes black-hole carrier motion with
  softened dominant-star orbits, adds bounded near-horizon frame dragging, differential tidal
  stretching, and carrier-only orbital decay, preserves Hooke tethers and short-range
  repulsion, and captures sub-escape drag releases into their authored star system while high
  velocity releases escape. A bounded canvas layer renders the central gravity well, lens halo,
  short trails, and up to 24 shallow local-star wells without adding simulation bodies.
- The dashboard Galaxy graph now caches its outer safety radius at 2× the initial painted
  extent; escaped nodes are confined to that fixed envelope instead of expanding it.
- The Galaxy gravity slider now spans `0..400` while retaining the release-stable default
  black-hole field of `240` and local field of `120`. Independent community stars run on a 2.5×
  orbital clock and retain the calibrated default stellar well when Gravity is zero. An explicit
  black hole now retains a smaller `24`-setting floor at the loose endpoint, so neither solar
  systems nor their planets silently stop while the displayed control remains at zero.
- The Galaxy default orbital separation is now `60`, a 25% increase from `48`. Link and contact
  projections remain contractive and correction-capped so dense layouts cannot overshoot or
  ping-pong. Same-system contacts project along each declared stellar orbit so they preserve
  radius and relative velocity while the dominant star remains fixed in the local system frame.
- Galaxy's `Orbital speed` control now scales local stellar rotation and whole-system rotation
  around the central galaxy anchor in both live and oversized kinematic layouts. Its faster
  endpoint also gives planets a modest 6% larger local orbital radius while the midpoint remains
  unchanged; saved views continue using `repel`.
- Direct black-hole graph connections now classify their non-anchor nodes as black-hole
  satellites, including legacy payloads without `system_anchor_id`, so those nodes rotate with
  the same Orbital speed phase.
- Carrier orbit support now adopts a node's post-contact phase before advancing it, preventing
  collision or boundary corrections from snapping nodes back to a stale lane angle and producing
  visible jitter.
- Oversized Galaxy fallback layouts now use the complete gravity range instead of saturating near
  the lower end of the slider.
- Complete Galaxy overview scenes remain expanded and physically live through 1,000 nodes and
  2,000 relations; larger Galaxy scenes and non-Galaxy full views retain the deterministic
  fallback.
- Historical graph views now keep at least one ghost relation's endpoints together under
  undersized node caps, and ghost evidence drilldowns resolve invalidated supporting memories
  instead of a colliding live canonical alias.

- The source-import consolidation loop now uses union-find (path halving) to merge overlapping
  clusters, replacing an O(n²) nested scan with near-linear time. The `consolidation_evidence_cache`
  is bounded to 1000 entries with clear-on-overflow to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Duplicate `_is_reparse_point` implementations across 4 modules (documents, obsidian, resources,
  vault) are extracted to a shared `core/fsutil.is_reparse_point` helper, eliminating code drift.
- Backend factory functions (`get_embedder`, `get_vector_index`, `get_transport`, `get_extractor`,
  `get_resource_extractor`, `get_postgres_introspector`) now declare Protocol-based return types,
  making the interface contract explicit and enabling static type checking.
- Graph visibility SQL helpers now use parameterized queries instead of `repr(float)` string
  interpolation, eliminating a fragile pattern that could theoretically be exploited if float
  representation ever produced non-numeric characters. The dead `_graph_edge_visibility_sql`
  helper is removed; `_graph_edge_history_visibility_sql` returns `(sql, params)` tuple.
- The dashboard graph scene endpoint (`/api/graph/scene`) now accepts a `presentation`
  query parameter (`quality` or `all`); the `all` profile requests the complete entity
  projection up to 20,000 nodes and 200,000 relationships with an explicit worker-backed
  LOD renderer, while `quality` retains the existing overview cap.
- Galaxy overview now retains the strongest cross-community bridge edge for every visible
  system pair plus every direct global-anchor link, so inter-system and black-hole
  relationships appear connected instead of isolated.
- Added `docs/GRAPH_PERFORMANCE.md` documenting the two graph presentation profiles,
  worker layout, progressive rendering, and the 20,000-node / 200,000-relation safety
  ceilings.
- Source-import manifest paging now uses keyset (cursor) pagination instead of OFFSET,
  so concurrent writes during a source re-import can no longer skip or duplicate rows
  mid-scan (PR #154).
- Local file/folder imports now accept up to 1,500 files per batch (was 500), with the total
  batch ceiling scaled to 750 MB so the average per-file allowance is unchanged; document-wizard
  scanner ceilings move in lockstep.
- Folder imports report truncation explicitly: a folder with more matching files than the
  ceiling now warns and returns `truncated`/`matched_total`/`unreadable` fields instead of
  silently importing an alphabetically-first slice that looks complete.
- The `engraphis_prime_agent` integration now ships a fleet wrapper that boots multiple
  sub-agents (researcher / coder / reviewer / writer) with one shared memory workspace,
  with fleet-wide configuration via `ENGRAPHIS_REPO` and per-agent override via the
  `repo=` argument; the `engraphis-prime-agent install` subcommand configures a target
  prime-agent configuration file and `python -m engraphis_prime_agent install`
  works directly from the installed wheel.

### Fixed

- The Every node dashboard view no longer crashes on open: a declaration-order bug in the
  renderer threw during construction before anything painted. The scene canvas also keeps its
  accessible role/label now instead of being hidden from assistive technology.
- Prompt-only recall now honours an opt-in `ENGRAPHIS_RECALL_ARM_CANDIDATE_K` env var (and
  the matching `RecallEngine(arm_candidate_k_cap=...)` constructor argument) that clamps both
  the first-page widening (`candidate_k + min(250, candidate_k*3)`) and the second-page
  ceiling, so operators can trade untrusted-scope widening for latency on the new k=50
  default without code changes. The accompanying benchmark test,
  `test_recall_arm_candidate_k_cap.py`, uses a 300-fact trusted corpus because both requested
  arm depths clamp to the same 49 rows on a smaller corpus and the timing assertion was
  unreliable. Default behaviour is unchanged.
- Import previews now page the source manifest exactly like execution, so vaults whose manifest
  outgrew one list page (10k identities) no longer show manifest-only files as silently absent
  from the preview plan; beyond-boundary rows are reported as `missing` instead of dropped.
  Manifest pages now use one read snapshot and de-duplicate identities that move across a
  cursor while a concurrent import updates their path.
- Importing more than 1,000 files through the dashboard no longer fails with "Internal Server
  Error": wizard upload routes parse multipart forms under the advertised 1,500-file ceiling
  instead of Starlette's hidden 1,000-part parser default, oversized batches return a clear 413,
  and large vault uploads no longer trip the dashboard's 8 MB default body limit.
- One unreadable or pathological file (locked, deep-nested JSON, concurrent writer) now degrades
  to a per-file error instead of rolling back the entire import batch with a 500.
- Document/Obsidian import jobs whose worker died with the process are marked failed on the next
  status poll (`worker_lease_expired`) instead of reporting `running` forever.
- Cloud-placeholder files (OneDrive Files-On-Demand) on Windows are hydrated and imported rather
  than rejected as non-regular files; symlinks and junctions remain blocked.
- Galaxy layout now packs each complete solar-system envelope before orbital seeding and keeps
  those envelopes separated with rigid carrier translations during live motion. Compact server
  targets can no longer stack large systems near the black hole, while local planet positions,
  velocities, event-horizon clearance, and the finite outer boundary remain intact.
- Galaxy hierarchy authority is now label-independent: an authored `anchor_role="global"`
  selects the central mass regardless of its display name or evidence mass, while unannotated
  compatibility scenes fall back deterministically through mass, rank, degree, and stable ID.
- The central black-hole adornment now advances a visible spin phase with the Galaxy physics
  clock, so an otherwise satellite-free core no longer appears frozen while remaining the fixed
  origin for the surrounding galaxy.
- Near-horizon curvature is now measured from each system's dominant-star carrier through a
  bounded black-hole-scale band. A wide solar system can no longer be misclassified as already
  inside the gravity well and have its ordinary galactic angular momentum drained.
- Galaxy systems revealed after the initial render, restored with zeroed velocity, or shown as
  singletons now receive their own black-hole-frame tangential admission instead of being marked
  seeded while stationary. Oversized Complete views use a bounded node-only hierarchical orbit
  clock, and visible historical ghosts move as massless test particles without entering gravity,
  contacts, or momentum.
- Galaxy members that appear before their eventual star, arrive through a later reveal, change
  parent systems, or return with a zeroed local phase now receive one star-relative circular seed
  without recoiling the dominant node. Existing healthy stellar orbits remain untouched.
- Dominant community stars now remain inertial at the centre of their moving solar-system frame.
  Local gravity, stellar contact, dense separation, seeding, speed limiting, and the oversized
  kinematic fallback move planets around that star instead of wobbling the star with its planets.
- Galaxy Reheat now wakes the persistent fixed-step clock without injecting bonus physics slices,
  and cross-system separation is bounded so it cannot kick entire solar systems into a visible
  fast-forward, ping-pong, or speed-cap pulse.
- Ledger graph reloads now retire and cache-bust a renderer that fetched successfully but failed
  to register, instead of replaying the same broken asset response.
- Existing Galaxy preferences migrate only the retired `48` orbital-separation default to `60`;
  deliberate custom values, including Gravity `0`, remain unchanged.
- Source-import hardening lands via separate PR #154: deterministic missing-item detection
  now guards an unknown baseline instead of reporting spurious misses, denial-guard
  supersession binds digests computed from the parsed record rather than raw input,
  import-job finalization is generation-guarded so a stale worker cannot finalize over a
   newer attempt, and the finalized-state check completes in constant time.
- Smart MCP `engraphis_session` now accepts `action="start_session"` and `action="end_session"`
  (the full tool-name forms the Command Code harness sends when translating the AGENTS.md
  `engraphis_start_session`/`engraphis_end_session` shorthand), normalizing them to `start`/`end`
  before the pattern validation instead of rejecting them with a 400.

### Documentation

- `docs/LLM_PROVIDERS.md` now warns Windows users that `cmd` may resolve to `cmd.exe`
  (the built-in Windows command interpreter) instead of the Command Code CLI, and explains
  how to diagnose and work around the PATH collision.

### Security


- HTTP error responses in `vault.py` and `service.py` no longer echo user-controlled paths back
  to the client, preventing filesystem structure leakage (SEC-001).
- Graph visibility SQL helpers now use parameterized queries instead of `repr(float)` string
  interpolation, eliminating a fragile SQL construction pattern (SEC-002).
- The `pypdf` dependency floor is raised to `>=6.15.0` to address PYSEC-2026-3655 and
  PYSEC-2026-3656 (arbitrary code execution via crafted PDF objects).

### Removed

- The Hermes memory-provider plugin integration (`integrations/hermes/`, its
  `ENGRAPHIS_HERMES_*` environment surface, and its integration test) is withdrawn from
  the repository ahead of the v1.6 tag. The provider remains available in the v1.5
  release history for anyone who already copied it.
## [1.6] - 2026-08-15

Minor release advancing the v2 engine through schema 16 with deterministic sync state, trusted
local document and Obsidian import, tighter trust boundaries, synchronized agent guidance, and
stronger release and evaluation evidence.

### Changed

- The dashboard graph now separates two explicit presentation budgets. **High quality** keeps the
  interactive renderer for focused exploration, while **Show all nodes** requests the complete
  entity projection and uses a worker-backed level-of-detail renderer with batched WebGL2 points,
  a bounded Canvas fallback, progressive relationship disclosure, and no live force simulation.
  The all-node profile supports up to 20,000 entities and 200,000 relationships; larger filtered
  results fail with an explicit capacity response instead of silently sampling an incomplete graph.
  Repository and entity-type filters remain the supported route for narrowing oversized views.
- The Ledger knowledge graph now defaults to evidence-mass Galaxy gravity. The `galaxy-v6`
  scene contract retains the magnitude of degree, PageRank, support, and repository evidence;
  one mass value determines both visibly distinct star radius and gravitational pull. Deterministic
  mass-ranked cores and orbital bands form local solar systems. The highest-evidence node becomes
  the central black hole, rendered at least twice the ordinary evidence radius so its event horizon
  remains visible at minimum Node size. Deterministic logarithmic arms seed a non-uniform disk, and
  a fixed-step leapfrog clock advances eccentric, differential system orbits through an
  evidence-derived core-plus-halo potential. Gravity now treats the dominant evidence node as
  the explicit black-hole source: its field is `240` at the default slider and `864` at maximum,
  while local solar-system, bridge, and drag gravity receives exactly half (`120` and `432`). The
  smooth response remains true-zero and monotonic, and the rest of the core community contributes
  through the softened halo rather than silently inflating the black-hole node's mass. External
  solar systems also exert a weaker softened mutual field on one another: nearby evidence-heavy
  systems perturb each other without requiring a relation edge, while the black hole remains the
  dominant galaxy-wide potential.
  The controlled centre pull is also doubled, retaining an immediate radial response rather than
  hiding the stronger field behind a slower projector. Galaxy dynamics no
  longer depend on D3 alpha decay, render cadence, or
  force-directed settling. Galactic and local-system motion now uses a `0.021328125` fixed timestep,
  another 30% slower than the preceding `0.03046875` cadence, while direct pointer movement remains responsive.
  Every live seed coordinate and local orbit begins another 20% inward, putting
  system centers at 40% of the original Galaxy radius. While live, the black-hole frame follows a
  controlled inward spiral: Gravity 0 holds the loose seeded radius, and default/maximum convergence
  now advances the same inward trajectory at 70% of its immediately preceding speed. Gravity slider input also
  applies an immediate, reversible system-center response without changing local geometry or velocity:
  its full range spans 40% radius contraction, and default-to-maximum visibly contracts about 31%
  synchronously while maximum gravity retains its 3.6x field;
  outward attempts still receive a 110% radial counter-projection and can never increase their
  radius. Link distance now drives same-system evidence springs with twice the prior response and
  a squared scale curve. Its default is now `8`, giving connected nodes a 0.25x rest length, 75%
  tighter than the preceding default, while the full range still spans 1/16x tight orbits through
  25x loose orbits without allowing
  cross-system relations to collapse the galaxy. A bounded mass-weighted positional relation
  constraint makes Link distance respond immediately while preserving each solar system's centre
  of mass. Orbital separation now owns an explicit same-system safety envelope instead of relying
  on an imperceptible softening side effect: both its positional response and cushion scale are
  doubled, spanning zero added space through 30 world units while preserving evidence-mass centre
  of mass and removing closing energy. Dense projections retain the requested
  compact radius and report unavoidable projected overlap instead of silently expanding the disk.
  Near the core, the direct close-encounter term is 25% lower and its weight moves into the smooth
  halo, reducing ejection without weakening the total evidence-mass field. Legacy layouts and
  `/api/graph` remain available.

### Fixed

- Replace the packed-disk Galaxy regression with persistent softened-Newtonian dynamics. Galaxy
  phase space is isolated from Compact and other legacy layouts, angular momentum is preserved
  across layout changes, and large stars are visibly distinct. A smooth evidence-mass field keeps
  each solar system bound while direct star-to-star gravity supplies smaller organic perturbations;
  evidence bridges remain visible provenance without injecting non-central orbital energy or
  relation springs compressing the scene into a graph blob. Dragging now leaves the fixed-step
  Galaxy clock live without alpha changes, global reheats, reseeding, or detaching any global force.
  The pointer owns exactly one moving mass source while every live body follows its softened
  inverse-square gravity, whether linked or unlinked; distance and evidence mass determine the
  response, and explicit relations only strengthen it. A bounded once-per-physics-slice projection
  makes nearby unlinked bodies visibly follow without teleporting, freezing the rest of the graph,
  or depending on pointer-event frequency. Pointer events update only the source position and
  field membership--the gravitational response is sampled by the 30 Hz physics clock. The selected
  Link orbit supplies a safe periapsis,
  tangential momentum is retained, and release adds no wake or impulse. Freeze remains the sole
  explicit motion gate. The explicit **Reheat layout** action now gives Galaxy a finite custom-
  solver relaxation burst (30 extra steps, or 12 for large live scenes) instead of merely ensuring
  its already-running clock exists; repeated clicks coalesce, current orbital phase is preserved,
  and no D3 alpha, random kick, or orbital reseed is introduced.
- Eliminate false Galaxy "reheating" caused by two local solvers fighting each other every tick.
  Link distance and Orbital separation now share the same lower-bound target, the redundant live
  velocity spring no longer injects energy alongside the positional constraint, and close-range
  separation dissipates closing radial motion. Correction-distance diagnostics expose whether a
  system is genuinely settling without changing its orbital phase or waking D3.
- Stabilize dense solar systems and high-degree hubs without weakening their gravity. Link and
  Orbital-separation constraints now sample one immutable phase and apply one simultaneous,
  mass-balanced update per node instead of stacking an update for every incident edge. Aggregate
  position and contact-velocity caps prevent a hub slingshot, while a system-relative speed fuse
  damps only anomalous member motion and preserves each free system's center-of-mass orbit.
- Show unlinked entities in new Ledger and Classic graph views by default so isolated evidence is
  not silently omitted. The toolbar still switches to a linked-only view, and persisted user or
  saved-view preferences remain authoritative.
- Keep large Galaxy scenes interactive by replacing quadratic entity-visibility scans with
  set-wise privacy pruning, driving evidence lookups from the requested relation IDs, and making
  Ledger retries cancel and supersede stale scene requests safely.

### Added

- A dependency-free, source-neutral local document importer for Markdown, plain text,
  reStructuredText, HTML, JSON/JSONL, CSV/TSV, configuration/XML text, and stdlib-readable
  source code, RTF, DOCX/ODT, XLSX/ODS, PPTX/ODP, and EPUB documents, with existing local
  adapters for PDF text, image OCR, and explicitly local-model audio/video transcription.
  `engraphis import documents` and the
  dashboard’s **Import local documents** flow
  provide strict previews, safe per-file reporting, resumable source manifests, temporal
  re-import history, and explicit conflict choices. Obsidian remains the rich Markdown adapter.
- Offline, repeatable Obsidian-vault import with strict dry-run previews, source
  safety exclusions, resumable per-note progress, temporal re-import history, and
  a trusted-owner dashboard wizard that uploads only `.md` note bytes plus content-free
  attachment manifests. It ships through
  `engraphis import obsidian`, the `engraphis-import` console alias, and a deprecated
  v1 seed-script wrapper that maps legacy namespaces to v2 workspaces.

### Security

- Fail closed on new `user`-scope memory writes until records carry an immutable owner identity;
  preserve historical reads and the existing promotion rejection instead of presenting
  workspace-bound rows as private personal memory.
- Parse bounded dotenv-style configuration without an optional runtime dependency, and load it only from the owner-private
  `~/.engraphis/config.env` or an absolute owner-private file selected by
  `ENGRAPHIS_ENV_FILE`; arbitrary working-directory `.env` files are not a trust boundary.
- Clarify Cloud Sync credential-origin binding, secret-manager-only unattended credentials,
  version-3 rollback evidence, and the deliberately incomplete first-contact state without
  claiming an untrusted relay can prove a complete device set.
- Advance through schema 15: schema 12 classifies content-free erasure markers so local-only
  `never_export` markers remain private and only validated `remote_erasure` markers may cross
  sync boundaries; schema 13 adds per-memory hybrid logical clocks for deterministic
  descriptive-state sync and durable, content-free proof that a memory crossed a sync boundary;
  schema 14 adds Obsidian collection and import manifests; schema 15 generalizes them to
  source-neutral `documents` and `obsidian` adapters, preserves temporal source lineage, enforces
  adapter/job and target-scope integrity, and retains only bounded, content-free per-job
  format/result metadata. Schema 16 persists the optional session target on import jobs and
  enforces exact session equality for source lineage and job items.
- Bind each trusted-owner dashboard document or Obsidian run to an expiring, owner-session-bound,
  one-time preview token over the exact note/document bytes, attachment manifest, target, source,
  and conflict policy; invalidate changed client previews and keep job polling and cancellation
  bound to the workspace where the job started.
- Make read-only Store inspection write-free for SQLite and injected/SQLCipher connectors:
  require injected connectors to expose `open_read_only(path)`, open existing checkpointed files
  with `mode=ro&immutable=1` plus `PRAGMA query_only=ON`, and reject missing paths or active
  WAL/rollback journals before a connector can create or recover state.

### Fixed

- Publish separately backed vector-index changes for service memory-title edits only after the
  canonical Store row, FTS mirror, portable vector, audit, and commit succeed; late Store failures
  publish nothing, while post-commit provider failures preserve canonical state and record
  content-free repair debt.
- Defer separately backed vector-index upserts and deletes during sync until each canonical apply
  batch commits, coalesce repeated IDs, publish nothing on late Store failure, and record
  content-free repair debt if the provider fails after commit.
- Synchronize the portable memory skill with the live Smart nine-tool and Classic 34-tool
  surfaces, including the two intentionally narrower Smart overlap schemas, trust/origin fields,
  planner and response bounds, context-savings filters, receipt anchors, and expanded health
  output.
- Separate append-only event rows from episodic memories in every agent guide: event rows are not
  recalled, deduplicated, reinforced, or consolidated, while recallable recurring outcomes use
  governed episodic memories.
- Make every documentation and image target in the PyPI long description an absolute canonical
  repository URL, and add offline contracts that reject future relative-link regressions.
- Replace unregistered external and consolidation numbers in the context-efficiency image with a
  checksum-bound public fixture artifact; publish exact commands plus suite/config digests and
  retain only deterministic aggregates reproduced by the checked-in offline fixtures.
- Align the canonical offline gate, protocol-only `core/` boundary and outer
  `engraphis/factory.py` composition root, deterministic versus entrypoint vector-backend
  selection, persistent embedding identity, v1 migration repair reporting, trusted configuration,
  and hosted/local boundaries across public docs.
- Remove the obsolete consolidation source-supersession option across public docs; consolidation
  now exposes only the explicit clustering, archival, profile, inference, structured, LLM, time,
  and level controls implemented by the engine.
- Document the official LongMemEval-V2 six-variant, five-budget execution matrix end to end,
  including clean-checkout completion receipts, exact source-question coverage, privacy-safe
  export binding, matched `context_k=2` comparators, and memory-type count evidence.

### Added

- Dashboard Settings panel and startup banner now display the running Engraphis
  version, fetched from the existing `/api/info` endpoint.

### Fixed

- Wrap `engraphis_get_memory` post-inspect body in error-redaction try/except
  matching all other Smart gateway tools, preventing internal SQL errors and
  file paths from leaking through FastMCP error responses.
- Fix malformed SQLite URI on Windows in `_keyword_search` and `/api/memories`
  fallback paths: use `Path.resolve().as_uri()` instead of bare string
  interpolation, matching the store's URI construction.
- Apply `_graph_csv()` limit enforcement to the `/graph` endpoint's `layers`
  parameter, matching all other graph endpoints.
- Log a warning when `ENGRAPHIS_LLM_EXTRA_HEADERS` contains invalid JSON
  instead of silently dropping the headers.

## [1.5] - 2026-08-04

Minor release advancing the v2 engine to schema 11 with governed recall recovery,
embedding-space safety, reproducible release evidence, and stronger offline memory-quality gates.

### Security

- Add opt-in immutable Hugging Face model provenance enforcement for remote embedding models,
  rerankers, and chunk tokenizers, with revision plumbing across v2 services and local front ends;
  model loaders now explicitly disable remote code execution while local paths remain supported.
- Refuse redirects in loopback startup-health and PyPI metadata probes, and treat shortcut icon
  paths as data across PowerShell, macOS shells, and Linux desktop files.
- Add an offline release gate proving that quarantined, review-pending, and caller-self-approved
  external content is downgraded and stays outside prompt recall, including direct poisoned
  edges and pending-memory-supported edges, while trusted graph evidence remains available.
- Reject control characters in hosted access and refresh credentials, including credentials
  returned during rotation, before any network or persistent-state use.
- Restrict the Inspector API to loopback clients when no API token is configured, and exclude
  pending or quarantined memories from managed-cloud snapshots.
- Harden update checks with bounded, link-safe cache reads, atomic private cache writes, strict
  version limits, finite timestamps, and validated HTTPS or loopback-HTTP URLs.
- Route private credential and state-file reads through one bounded, race-resistant boundary that
  rejects links, reparse points, non-regular files, invalid UTF-8, and oversized input.
- Raise the optional `cryptography` floor to 50.0.0 to exclude known vulnerable releases.
- Require the patched pytest line in supported release environments and give every CI pytest
  invocation a private runner-owned temporary root, including the Python 3.9 compatibility lane.

### Fixed

- In schema 11, migrate pre-review trusted memories to explicit approval without releasing quarantined or
  ambiguous evidence; recover the exact historical local-agent service-gate downgrade and expose
  content-free eligibility diagnostics when review gating causes zero-result recall.
- Replace per-backend vector version checks with one active embedding-space fingerprint, make
  Sentence Transformer/API spaces durable, rebuild on every space transition (including
  A -> B -> A), and disable vector recall throughout interrupted or mixed-space rebuilds.
- Describe the stable sqlite-vec backend accurately as native exact KNN, add a dedicated
  `vector` install extra, require the upstream release containing the vec0 delete fix,
  and let server entrypoints select it automatically with a safe NumPy fallback.
- Make contradiction supersession failure-atomic so a failed predecessor invalidation cannot
  leave two live facts.
- Bound reinforcement stability and migrate existing out-of-range retention state to schema 10.
- Preserve v1 graph endpoints during migration and publish migrated databases only after a
  validated staging database is complete.
- Reject partial API embedding batches instead of persisting zero-vector placeholders; give
  semantic embedding spaces durable, secret-free identities; and batch SQLite vector hydration.
- Prevent CLI metadata from overriding trusted local provenance and honor the selected namespace
  for grounded chat.
- Keep service replacement atomic when the prior SQLite handle cannot close, and make
  authoritative cloud denials fail closed in-process before their durable state writes complete.
- Keep tag publication reachable by defining every workflow-verified release check in the public
  evidence manifest, including CodeQL, reproducible distributions, and fresh artifact smokes, and
  bind the evidence provenance to the completed code-security job.
- Repair GitHub releases only from the frozen, hash-verified distribution set, excluding any
  publisher receipt or other unverified file left in the working distribution directory.
- Exercise both the exact tagged wheel and source distribution in clean Python 3.9 environments,
  including dependency resolution, pip check, core CLI startup, and in-memory remember/recall;
  declare the CI build and vulnerability-audit tool versions instead of relying on runner images.
- Eliminate duplicate NumPy vector writes and commits after ordinary remembers, embedding rebuilds,
  sync application, and title re-embedding. Store-backed indexes opt out only when they share the
  exact canonical Store; separately-backed and injected indexes retain explicit synchronization.
- Replace row-by-row NumPy scan hydration with one filtered, fixed-width matrix read while
  preserving temporal/scope filters, malformed-dimension isolation, deterministic ties, and
  immediate visibility of newly written vectors.
- Surface best-effort graph, entity-linking, evolution, conflict-repair, and index-audit failures as
  per-engine rate-limited, payload-redacted warnings instead of silently suppressing operational
  faults.
- Honor the configured embedding dimension, vector backend, model revisions, reranker, and encrypted
  connection path consistently across every v2 front end and the sync/consolidation CLIs, preventing
  an operational command from accidentally rebuilding a persisted semantic space with defaults.
- Commit standalone entity links without closing a caller-owned transaction, and make the Windows
  shortcut installer retain its redacted Desktop launcher fallback when PowerShell is unavailable.
- Serialize and make Store shutdown idempotent, add context-manager and weakref-finalizer cleanup,
  and keep the offline suite from loading production embedding/reranker models merely because a
  developer has optional semantic dependencies installed.

### Added

- Extend `eval.vector_scale` with input-identical NumPy/sqlite-vec exact-KNN comparisons,
  explicit backend identity, deterministic result hashes, and setup-excluded latency envelopes.
- Add `engraphis-cli review list|approve` for content-free, scoped bulk review. Approval is
  dry-run by default, requires a reason and one batch confirmation, excludes quarantined records,
  and supports explicit ids, source/repo filters, and the legacy-agent signature.
- Add embedding coverage and prompt-eligibility health to service stats, stamp service ingress and
  writer-policy provenance, and document recall recovery without direct database surgery.
- Add deterministic reinforcement and adversarial-memory release gates plus a hash-bound LoCoMo
  evidence-repair manifest and complete pinned-dataset retrieval diagnostics.
- Pin the Pyright contract for core, backends, and external evaluation; require it in CI and release
  evidence; verify distribution contents; generate a reproducible CycloneDX SBOM; byte-compare
  normalized repeat builds; smoke fresh wheel/sdist installs; and bind complete-tree CodeQL to the
  tag gate.
- Smoke all 14 installed console entrypoints from their distribution metadata and generated wrapper
  paths for both wheel and source-distribution installs, with bounded timeouts and diagnostics.
- Add opt-in semantic-confidence calibration for retrieval-arm experiments while preserving the
  existing default ranking until paired external non-inferiority evidence is available.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-08-04

Patch release aligning the package, runtime, commercial manifest, and plugin metadata at 1.4.5
for the governed recall/write hardening, schema 8 migration, Smart MCP gateway fixes, and
credential-safe evaluation capture included in PR #111.
Schema 9 adds repository-scoped tombstone support and performs a one-time entity-canonicalization
repair; `confidence` and `pinned_at`/`unpinned_at` were introduced by the preceding v7-to-v8
migration. Known-repository tombstones are terminal only within that repository, while legacy
repo-less tombstones remain global.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-02

Engraphis 1.4 makes the compact Smart MCP gateway the default agent interface while preserving
the complete Classic surface for existing integrations. It also strengthens external-write
governance,
bounded context delivery, secure erasure, and release/runtime hardening, and moves the v2 SQLite
schema to version 9 (schema-level additions include repository-scoped `memory_tombstones`; the
upgrade also performs a one-time entity-canonicalization repair), which migrates automatically on
first open. Known-repository tombstones are terminal only within that repository; legacy repo-less
tombstones remain global.

### Upgrade notes

- `engraphis-mcp` now exposes nine Smart tools instead of 34 direct tools. Clients that depend on
  the former names should switch their server command to `engraphis-mcp-classic`; HTTP clients can
  use `engraphis-mcp-http --classic`.
- Existing v2 databases migrate automatically to schema 9 on first open; the change is additive
  and requires no manual step.
- The NumPy-only core supports Python 3.9+. Dashboard, MCP, documents, Cloud Sync, and `all`
  installations require Python 3.10+ because their supported dependency versions require it.

### Added

- Smart MCP is now the zero-configuration `engraphis-mcp` default. It exposes nine compact tools:
  sessions, prompt-ready recall, durable memory, discovery, validated read/action execution, and
  governed record read/update plus conflict review. `engraphis-mcp-classic` preserves the former 34
  direct tool names and legacy alias response shapes for pinned integrations.
- The first-party `@engraphis/pi` package under `integrations/pi` exposes that Smart MCP surface
  as native Pi tools, verifies the Engraphis 1.4.x handshake, and ships with independent npm
  packaging and release gates.
- Hosts that retain their own conversation history can call the non-MCP
  `POST /api/adaptive-context` endpoint. Advanced proactive context also supports a bounded,
  content-lean compact response while Classic keeps its full response by default.
- Opt-in planned recall adds a bounded deterministic planner, an injectable planner protocol and
  optional LLM backend, priority-weighted multi-query RRF, post-rerank memory-type maxima, stable
  context revisions, and diagnostics-only planner traces across Python, service, REST, and MCP
  recall surfaces. The default remains the existing single-query path (now on schema 9).
- A 40-task context-routing stress fixture, four-way five-budget ablation harness, pinned
  LongMemEval-V2 planner configurations, and evaluation-only imported-resource hierarchy prototype
  encode local regression gates and matrix tooling. Official benchmark, safety, and hosted-cache
  artifacts remain mandatory before any default or schema change.

### Security

- The Pi extension preserves the Smart gateway's destructive boundary: every discovered
  state-changing action requires an explicit Pi confirmation, fails closed without a dialog,
  and consumes its capability after one approval attempt so unknown outcomes are not retried.
- Public writes now enter an explicit review gate: MCP, REST/dashboard-intent, import, sync, and
  extractor ingress are pending regardless of a caller-supplied trust label; detector matches are
  quarantined before they can contribute to prompt context or derived state. Human approval creates
  a fresh audited successor only through the CSRF-bound dashboard action or an interactive TTY
  command, never through MCP or a general REST endpoint. Historical rescans demote non-approved
  records and retire their derived bridges. Public history, graph/code retrieval and indexing, and
  consolidation apply prompt eligibility before ranking or capacity decisions, so pending or
  quarantined records cannot influence prompt-visible results through derived bridges.
- Smart MCP authorization now fails closed: discovery and read execution require viewer access,
  state-changing execution requires admin access remotely, and pure reads do not emit write-side
  telemetry receipts. Executor output is bounded without retrying or double-running handlers.
- Tokenless remote requests to the read-only recall and repository-graph API now fail closed;
  health and OpenAPI discovery remain public.
- The deterministic detector now uses a pinned Unicode TR39 15.1.0 ASCII projection rather than
  a short hand-picked table, covering additional Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, mathematical, and legacy
  glyph substitutions without an online lookup or runtime dependency.
- Secret scanning is cycle-safe and depth-bounded, and PostgreSQL source identities are reduced to
  credential-free digests for both URI and libpq keyword DSNs.

### Fixed

- Secure erase now rebuilds shared-edge provenance from surviving support rows. Historical-only
  support remains available to time-travel reads while the edge is closed in the current graph.
- API embedding backends now validate dimensions, response cardinality, item indices, finite
  values, and normalization before accepting provider output, with consistent bounded fallback.
- Planned-recall datasets reject dangling references, vector dimensions are bounded across local
  and SQLite backends, and sync imports accept pinned state only when it is the literal boolean
  `true`.
- The production image now removes build-only pip and its vendored dependency snapshot after
  installation, eliminating unreachable vulnerable packages from the runtime attack surface.
- Automatic LLM retention supervision now discards proposed retention values when it
  demotes an unapproved `critical` label; legacy poisoning rescans also honor
  `--keep-unlabelled`, and code-memory exports apply eligibility before their result cap.
- Scope promotion now preserves an owner-approved detector match and its stable claim identity
  without re-quarantining the approved derived copy.
- `engraphis connect` now treats its printed summary as a provider trust boundary: only bounded,
  printable registration metadata is rendered, preventing malformed control-plane values from
  being reflected into CLI or JSON output.
- Explicit local `engraphis-cli ingest` commands now record local-owner-approved provenance,
  allowing their memories to appear in ordinary subsequent CLI recall. HTTP, MCP, import, and
  file-ingestion boundaries remain pending review.
- The standalone v1→v2 migrator now refuses in-place and pre-existing output paths before
  opening either database, preventing accidental mixing of legacy source history into a v2 target.
- Cloud Sync now closes failed HTTP response streams without reading their untrusted error bodies,
  preventing descriptor leaks during repeated relay failures.
- Hosted customer clients now bind provider credential/session state before persistence and
  preserve sanitized authorization/billing outcomes when an HTTP error body is truncated, so a
  one-time connection cannot be stranded by an unreadable state file or retain stale paid badges.
- Authoritative hosted managed-compute authorization denials now immediately settle local
  entitlement presentation state, so a revoked, lapsed, or de-authorized account is not shown
  stale paid feature access while awaiting a background refresh.
- The production image health probe now follows the active IPv4 or IPv6 loopback listener,
  preventing a Railway IPv6 deployment from being marked unhealthy while its readiness route
  is serving traffic.
- Grounded recall's absolute support floor ignores titles and non-finite semantic scores, so
  display text cannot independently make an answer eligible.
- Keyed-claim deduplication ignores harmless punctuation, and legacy zero, negative, or non-finite
  stability values use the documented one-day default instead of producing invalid decay scores.
- Approval requires a non-empty audit reason, accepts only a live pending source, and preserves the
  reviewed claim's pin, sensitivity, and keyed identity on its approved successor.
- The zero-config Compose quickstart remains loopback-only; a LAN deployment is an explicit,
  token-protected operator choice and cannot inherit the local Docker bridge trust exception.
- Credential-shaped values are rejected before capture can create memory, FTS, vector, event, or
  sync copies. `retire` is the canonical temporal lifecycle operation; targeted `secure_erase`
  removes an already-leaked record and known local derivatives while reporting physical limits.
- The standalone MCP-over-HTTP launcher is explicitly loopback-only. Remote MCP clients must use
  the dashboard's authenticated `/mcp` endpoint instead of an unauthenticated FastMCP bind.

### Changed

- MCP-over-HTTP has a packaged `engraphis-mcp-http` command and a generic local setup guide. The
  project makes no client-specific integration claim without a maintained guide and integration
  test.
- `.env.example` now mirrors runtime defaults for decay, context packing, loop cadence, and recall
  depth so copied configurations do not silently override the documented behavior.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- The optional `hosted-eval` extra adds guarded hosted-Luna productivity evaluation with a
  redacted public evidence exporter.
- Protected public benchmark workflows now support redacted hosted and retrieval evidence runs.

### Security

- Untrusted ingress now fails closed: provenance and extractor metadata are allowlisted, suspicious
  records are quarantined before embedding, linking, graph extraction, resolution, recall, or
  grounding, and `scripts/rescan_poisoning.py` can retroactively label or quarantine old records.
- Trust is preserved across resolution, structured graph writes, consolidation, entity profiles,
  and review paths. Untrusted records cannot mutate or promote trusted memory, and derived outputs
  remain trusted only when every source is explicitly trusted.

### Documentation

- README and release guidance now match the current install extras, public entry points, product
  boundaries, and focused MCP/provider documentation.

### Fixed

- Public server entry points now share the v2 service, keeping recall behavior consistent across
  the dashboard, server, Compose, Classic, and MCP-over-HTTP.
- Keyed mutable-fact replacements now load their live predecessor directly, so reworded updates
  preserve history without relying on vector top-K recall.
- Versioned deterministic embeddings now rebuild persisted vectors after a mapping change, keeping
  existing databases searchable after an upgrade.
- Prompt-facing recall now widens candidate search when untrusted results crowd out trusted
  evidence, while keeping expansion bounded. Title text now contributes to absolute support floors
  for grounded and hosted recall.
- Hosted productivity evaluation now scores canonical, acceptable, or supporting-evidence answers
  with strict natural-language framing instead of token containment or raw JSON text.
- Hosted-Luna workers on Windows now establish kill-on-close containment before sending input; a
  failure refuses the request, and timeouts clean up the full worker tree.
- Poisoning rescans preserve existing temporal validity boundaries and invalidate affected edges
  without overwriting governed history.

### Changed

- CI and release/install metadata now cover Python 3.13 and 3.14.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `engraphis_context_savings` aggregates validated, content-free recall receipts by workspace,
  repo, operation, and token-counter identity. The view is available through the service,
  dashboard, and read-only APIs.
- Recall supports an explicit adaptive candidate-depth experiment while retaining the historical
  fixed depth by default. Performance reports record requested and actual candidate depths.
- `MemoryEngine` and `MemoryService` now provide adaptive context routing: bypass retrieval when
  prompt history fits, use compact recall when support is strong, and fall back to bounded recent
  history when support is weak.
- `eval.productivity` measures task completion, corrections, agent turns, memory calls, latency,
  and model-facing tokens.
- Chunk ingestion can enforce budgets with a configured Hugging Face tokenizer and records the
  counter identity, target, and overlap in chunk metadata.
- Offline adapters now cover MemoryAgentBench, LoCoMo-Plus, and Mem2ActBench, with a paired
  full-history versus Engraphis code-agent analyzer.
- Public benchmark evidence can carry source hashes, repository state, environment and model
  provenance, secret-redacted commands and URLs, content digests, and adjacent immutable SHA-256
  files.

### Changed

- Context-economy evaluation now compares full history, a same-budget recency window, and hybrid
  recall while accounting for indexing cost.
- Official LongMemEval-V2 output has a dedicated redacted evidence exporter that retains the
  official QA, token, and latency measures without publishing prompts, answers, model output, or
  retrieved context.
- Folder-sync dry runs no longer create a remote directory or persist a local device identity.

### Fixed

- Sync rejects malformed scope/repo combinations and every peer-driven visibility change for an
  existing memory, including malformed legacy rows. Scope promotion or repair remains a local,
  explicit governance operation.
- Workspace consolidation excludes session-private memories and partitions digests and entity
  profiles by their exact visibility owner, preventing cross-repo or cross-scope summaries.
- Tokenizer-aware chunk overlap can no longer exceed the configured prose budget or emit a
  duplicate overlap-only record before an oversized paragraph. Invalid token counters fail
  closed instead of silently producing mis-sized chunks.
- Ledger graph interactions preserve manually selected nodes during refreshes.
- The new evidence guide is included in wheel and source distributions.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Cloud Sync now continues past legacy plaintext, malformed, and tampered relay objects while
  still failing closed for each object. Later authenticated peer bundles apply, and the affected
  sync round is explicitly reported as incomplete rather than successful.
- Security and sync documentation now consistently distinguish end-to-end encrypted Cloud Sync
  from the separately readable managed-compute snapshot service.
- README visual PNG exports now use their SVG canvas dimensions without hidden screenshot padding.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Security

- Cloud Sync now encrypts every eligible shared-workspace bundle on the client with
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 before upload. The relay receives opaque deterministic bundle names and
  ciphertext only; tampered, renamed, cross-workspace, wrong-key, and legacy plaintext bundles
  are rejected before the merge engine.
- Cloud Sync requires a client-held 32-byte workspace key and the `cloud-sync` optional runtime.
  Missing or malformed encryption configuration stops sync rather than falling back to plaintext.

### Changed

- Cloud Sync privacy copy now states that eligible shared-workspace changes are encrypted
  end-to-end before leaving the device and cannot be read by Engraphis Cloud. Product and
  security documentation separately identifies managed compute as the readable, bounded-snapshot
  service it is.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- `engraphis_recall_context` brings the MCP surface to 30 tools and is the compact, hard-budget
  path for agent prompts. It returns packed context, compact source identities, strict token usage
  fields, optional retrieval diagnostics, and preserves `engraphis_recall` as the full-response
  compatibility surface.
- Recall and grounded recall now expose `valid_at` (world time) and `known_at` (system time);
  `as_of` remains the compatible `valid_at` alias and conflicting anchors are rejected. Retrieval
  defaults to the `balanced` profile; `auto` remains explicit opt-in.
- MCP and HTTP remember calls can set a fact's world-time `valid_from`; recall, grounded recall,
  and the compatibility answer tool can run a point-in-time `as_of` query.
- `eval.performance` reports full recall-pipeline quality, packed context tokens, and
  p50/p95/p99 latency with a reproducible JSON schema and deterministic corpus scaling.
- Schema v5 adds temporal history for symbols, code edges, code-memory links, and persisted
  memory-entity incidence. Code retrieval is now a first-class profile, and graph walks use
  bounded sparse PageRank instead of a dense quadratic transition matrix.
- Optional `subject_key` and `claim_kind` make mutable claims explicit. Uncertain similar facts
  are conservatively related while keyed or strongly evidenced contradictions supersede.
- `engraphis-benchmark/v2`, canonical workspace exports, and release-evidence manifests provide
  deterministic hashes, per-question records, fixed token-budget curves, and validation before
  public evidence is written.

### Fixed

- Supersessions now close the old fact at the replacement's effective world time instead of its
  ingestion time. Superseded, corrected, promoted, merged, forgotten, and consolidated source
  vectors remain available to historical semantic recall while temporal filters keep them out of
  the current view.
- Non-finite write and recall timestamps fail validation instead of entering scoring or SQLite.
- Ordinary recall is observational by default, so weak nearest-neighbor results do not gain
  stability merely by being returned. Grounded recall still reinforces only cited evidence, and
  Python callers with an explicit use signal can request reinforcement.
- Code and PPR retrieval now restrict incident-symbol and memory-entity lookups to the reachable
  frontier before applying their safety caps, and repo writes link text mentions to visible
  workspace-level entities.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Simplified the Ledger and Classic graph controls by removing the complete-graph action.
- Replaced the README Knowledge Graph image with the corrected Ledger screenshot.

### Fixed

- Ledger now has one working `Show unlinked nodes` control that reloads the intended bounded
  graph view.
- Time-travel graph views prioritize support visible at the selected anchor, and graph drag
  handling remains safe when browser animation-frame globals are unavailable.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **The complete Ledger design is now the primary local WebUI**, ported from the final
  five-area design package without its sample store or unsafe design runtime. Today, grounded
  Ask, Library, the advanced Graph & Relations view, Provenance, and Manage all use live v2 data.
  Manage includes workspaces, reviewed local consolidation, hosted Analytics/Automation/Team
  status, the full plan comparison, settings, and persisted Slate, Midnight, Paper, and Matrix
  themes.
- Ledger now exposes the production grounded-answer route (`POST /api/answer`), returning a
  cited answer or an explicit abstention. Graph & Relations ships the supplied graph capabilities:
  five layouts, four render styles, palettes, degree/betweenness sizing, bridge detection,
  valid-time filtering, superseded ghosts, focus, and automatic cluster collapse.
- The complete former dashboard remains available at `/classic`. Both interfaces expose a
  visible dashboard selector and share the same workspaces, memories, receipts, and engine.

### Changed

- Ledger defers both the CSP-sensitive renderer and graph payload until Graph & Relations is opened,
  ignores stale workspace responses, renders memory text through DOM text nodes, and provides
  responsive, reduced-motion-aware keyboard focus styling. Classic loads its lazy graph vendor
  dependency from its own packaged backup tree.
- Graph nodes now use oversampled, cached screen-space material rendering with face-level
  texture: full-face iridescent PVD for Cyber, directional blue-violet anodizing for Galaxy,
  concentric brushed copper for Solar, and horizontal satin gunmetal grain for Classic, with
  deterministic low-detail fallbacks for large graphs.
- Dashboard asset URLs now carry the node-material revision and local static responses
  revalidate, preventing an already-open browser from pinning the pre-material renderer.
- Pro and Team purchase actions now preserve both the selected plan and billing interval, while
  existing or lapsed subscribers are sent to the plan-neutral account portal for billing recovery.
  Public documentation now distinguishes hosted-account grace and recovery behavior from the
  always-local, Apache-licensed dashboard and MCP write paths.

### Fixed

- Token-protected dashboards can now establish a short-lived signed, HttpOnly browser session
  without storing the API token in browser storage. Remote peers remain denied when no token is
  configured, and non-loopback v1 server startup is refused unless authentication is enabled.
- Hosted entitlement refreshes use bounded exponential backoff, terminal denials settle every
  local entitlement view, inactive sessions expose no paid feature flags, and ambiguous
  single-use refresh responses permanently retire the possibly spent credential instead of
  replaying it.
- Recommended Automation bootstrap is resumable across partial upload/policy-save failures and
  authorizes paid work before generating or locking a local snapshot.
- Release checks now enforce commercial prices and trial terms, expose skipped tests instead of
  hiding them behind duplicate quiet flags, and verify the full-stack dependency imports used by
  the HTTP authorization boundary.

### Security

- Credential state directories are owner-only, product token forms are redacted consistently
  from logs, checkout overrides fail closed to validated HTTPS or loopback HTTP destinations, and
  unsafe control characters can no longer reform blocked browser URL schemes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

Public 1.1.0 hosted-connect and graph-experience release.

### Added

- **`engraphis connect --token engr_ct_…`**: the missing client half of device connect.
  `cloud_session.save_bootstrap()` is the only writer of `~/.engraphis/cloud_session.json`,
  and it had no production caller: the docs told paying customers to prefer a file nothing
  created, so a purchased installation could not be connected without hand-writing state.
  The new command redeems the one-time connect token from the account portal against
  `POST /v1/devices/connect`, saves the returned session with owner-only permissions, and
  verifies `cloud_session.configured()` before reporting success. The token is sent in the
  request body and nowhere else; it is never printed, logged, or written to disk, and every
  refusal maps to fixed, actionable copy (an expired or already-used token is not confused
  with a lapsed subscription). Session storage is pre-flighted before the exchange, so an
  unwritable state directory or a `cloud_session.json` replaced by a link fails the command
  *without* spending the single-use token; the customer fixes the path and retries with the
  same token instead of returning to the portal for a new one. Faults that can only happen
  *after* the exchange: a reply truncated mid-body (`http.client.IncompleteRead`), or an
  endpoint that stops resolving before the session is written (`CloudUrlUnresolved`) are
  reported as errors that say the token was already used, rather than escaping as tracebacks
  that leave the customer unable to tell whether to retry. Also installed as
  `engraphis-connect`.
- An `engraphis` front-door command that dispatches to the existing `engraphis-<verb>`
  entry points, so the command the account portal displays is runnable as shown.
- A stable per-installation identity at `~/.engraphis/client_identity.json` (random ULIDs,
  not a hardware fingerprint) so reconnecting a machine updates its existing installation
  instead of registering a new device every time.

### Removed

- Removed an unimplemented hosted export claim from public product surfaces.

### Changed

- Managed compute consent now travels with the cloud account: an installation connected to
  Engraphis Cloud is enabled for managed analytics, dreaming, and consolidation **by
  default**, because connecting already accepts the terms that cover it. A local-only
  installation with no cloud session is still never allowed.
  `ENGRAPHIS_MANAGED_COMPUTE_CONSENT` remains as an explicit operator override (`=0` opts a
  connected installation back out, `=1` forces it on regardless of session state) and is no
  longer surfaced anywhere in the UI.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-24

Public 1.0.1 client reliability release.

### Fixed

- Cloud Sync now defaults to `https://relay.engraphis.com` and safely migrates the former
  dashboard host and retired Railway relay URL without changing customer-provided relay URLs.
- Default Pro and Team upgrade links now target the live authenticated account portal rather
  than the retired Team dashboard host.
- Hosted endpoint validation now fails closed unless DNS establishes a globally routable
  destination, and credential-bearing HTTPS connections pin the vetted address while preserving
  original-host TLS verification to prevent DNS-rebinding SSRF.
- Hosted Automation and maintenance requests now use the selected workspace end to end rather
  than silently falling back to the first workspace.
- The Automation tab has one proposal action, clear managed-upload disclosure, and explicit
  managed-compute consent in addition to entitlement checks, snapshot redaction, and limits.
- Commercial metadata now describes Pro as one owner account across that owner's local
  installations, matching the hosted entitlement model; Team remains billed per named seat.
- API error responses and provider logs no longer expose arbitrary exception or configuration
  text; local folder and repository reads resolve and re-check filesystem boundaries.
- Entity extraction and dashboard asset migration avoid adversarial regular-expression
  backtracking. CodeQL now disables pull-request diff-informed analysis and CI fails on every
  raw SARIF result, including pre-existing and source-suppressed results.
- The documented grounded-recall evaluation prints with the default Windows console encoding.
- Hosted Pro and Team links preserve the selected plan through account creation and Checkout.
- A total `401`/`402`/`403` Cloud Sync authorization loss restores the hosted recovery CTA,
  while a successful empty or read-only workspace remains a partial result instead of being
  misreported as a total denial.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-23

Public 1.0.0 open-core GA release.

### Added

- The search-first Galaxy Knowledge Graph explorer with deterministic communities, canonical
  evidence-weighted scenes, entity/relation search, temporal filtering, evidence and history
  inspection, strongest-evidence paths, synchronized accessible tables, saved scene state,
  local PNG/JSON/CSV export, Simple and Advanced views, and a locally bundled ForceGraph + D3 renderer
  under the strict same-origin CSP.
- Additive schema-v4 canonical identity and bi-temporal edge-support records; deterministic
  graph scene, suggestion, entity, and path APIs; and a persisted graph-index job with dry-run,
  progress, cancellation, bounded errors, audit records, and tamper-evident receipts.
- A 29-tool MCP surface with explicit behavior annotations, operation receipts, exact session
  retry semantics, portable plugin manifests, and checksummed skill assets.
- Customer-side hosted protocols for scoped Cloud Sync, rotating cloud sessions, Analytics,
  and managed Automation requests, plus explicit manual folder exchange for local workflows.

### Changed

- The public distribution is a universal Python open-core package that runs only as a customer
  node. Hosted authorization, billing, relay storage, managed compute, Team identity, workers,
  and vendor operations remain private services.
- Commercial compatibility modules now expose presentation and customer-protocol metadata only;
  no environment variable turns the public package into a hosted Engraphis service.
- Session identity is exact across workspace, repo, authenticated user, agent, and goal; callers
  can request a distinct run with `force_new=true` and observe retry reuse explicitly.
- The legacy graph view defaults to deterministic community islands, keeps sparse influence
  bridges subordinate, and renders bounded A-MEM links when entity extraction is disabled. The
  repository screen demo proves session handoff, bi-temporal supersession, recall evidence, and
  history without an external service.
- The hosted no-card trial is exactly 3 active days after email confirmation. A separate
  `workspace_write_grace` may preserve ordinary local writes for at most 24 hours but never
  extends trial or paid cloud access.
- Apache-2.0 rights in published releases remain irrevocable; proprietary hosted value is
  enforced by the private implementation and service authorization boundary.

### Fixed

- Session start/end and session-scoped writes are atomic under concurrency; exact retries reuse
  one session while intentionally separate runs remain distinct.
- Rotating refresh credentials serialize across threads and processes, persist replacements in
  owner-only state, close failed HTTP responses, and never regress to a stale bootstrap value.
- Managed snapshots reserve a monotonic generation in the same local write transaction as the
  capture, use one operation ID per run and retry, redact provider errors, reject unknown
  sensitivity, exclude session and secret data, and enforce exact record/byte limits.
- Graph reads, suggestions, evidence, history, indexing, exports, audit views, fallback search,
  and workspace statistics consistently enforce workspace and session boundaries, including
  forgotten session-only graph evidence.
- Windows private-state validation uses safe file metadata checks without weakening symlink,
  ownership, size, or atomic-publication protections.
- Recall graph seeding uses one boundary-aware compiled pattern instead of rescanning every
  memory per entity, and the streamable HTTP launcher warms the singleton service before
  accepting clients.
- Graph GET requests remain read-only and return a rebuilding conflict while an explicit
  mutating index job is in progress.

### Security

- Bare memory IDs, shared-workspace controls, graph entities, statistics, snapshots, exports,
  audit rows, and keyword fallbacks cannot cross authenticated session or workspace boundaries.
- Managed uploads require explicit customer consent, are capped at 16 MiB and 100,000 rows,
  omit all session-scoped and secret-class memories, and surface only fixed client-safe
  provider errors.
- Customer credentials remain owner-only, redirect-safe, serialized during rotation, and are
  never substituted with an unproven local machine identifier.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-07-18

Security and reliability release spanning graph isolation and performance, Team / Pro
authentication, licensing and relay behavior, and the redesigned Knowledge Graph.

### Security

- Code-graph search, path, impact, export, and unified-graph reads now apply the same
  workspace/repo/session hierarchy filter as recall. Session-scoped memory content and
  identifiers previously remained reachable through persisted code-memory links from a
  repo-level caller. Reindexing still rebuilds those links for the owning session, but
  every read now filters them by caller-visible scope.
- Auth-bound dashboard users can no longer omit `workspace` to reach global recall.
  Inspector per-user and deployment bearer tokens now bind real or synthetic identities
  before personal receipt reads, so the deployment service account remains available for
  shared automation without bypassing personal-folder ownership. The standalone
  read-only graph endpoint also disables lazy write-on-read backfill.
- Repository indexing now creates a first-time Team workspace through the same
  privacy-aware path as remember/import/session writes, instead of silently creating a
  shared, unowned folder for the authenticated user.

### Fixed

- Code-graph layer responses and filters now use the concrete persisted layer, including
  inferred causal relations and explicitly semantic code edges. Code-memory link rebuilds
  page through every live repo-associated memory instead of clearing the bridge and
  stopping at 5,000, and Git impact parsing uses NUL-delimited paths without rewriting
  valid filename characters.
- Graph layer predicates are applied before workspace and code-edge response caps, and an
  explicit all-off layer selection remains empty instead of reverting to every layer.
  Layout preset and custom link-distance changes also recompute component centers while
  preserving the existing graph data and node objects.
  Filter reloads also tolerate transient graph-data invalidation, so restoring layers
  redraws the canvas instead of leaving the explorer list beside an empty graph.
- Oversized audio/video resources are rejected before transcription begins. A blank
  `ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_TOKEN` now correctly falls back to `ENGRAPHIS_API_TOKEN`.
- The sync relay now has its own per-IP token bucket
  (`ENGRAPHIS_RELAY_RATE_PER_MINUTE`, default 600) instead of sharing the
  60-request/minute license-registration budget. A full 64-bundle sync round can complete
  without throttling its final requests, while invalid-key floods remain bounded before
  Ed25519 verification.
- Every `/start-trial/verify` response (success, each error, and the 429) sends
  `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`. The request URL carries
  the one-time token, so the error pages are as Referer-leaky as the success page that
  holds the key; they previously used separate inline header literals and had drifted.

### Changed

- `GET /api/auth/users` checks `admin` at the route, matching `auth.min_role()`. The
  middleware already enforced admin, so this is defense in depth with no behaviour change;
  the route previously said `member`, which was dead code that misrepresented the policy.
- Successful version-tag publication now creates the matching GitHub Release and attaches
  the same validated wheel and source distribution sent to PyPI. Manual workflow dispatch
  remains build/check-only, and the release job is tag-gated behind successful PyPI
  publication.
- The Knowledge Graph defaults to compact component-aware packing and adds community,
  radial, constellation, original, and custom layouts; selectable Cyberpunk, Galaxy,
  Solar system, and Classic visual styles with persisted palettes; per-type node colors;
  a synchronized keyboard-accessible explorer; collision-aware labels; and responsive
  controls. Large graphs reuse rendered data, cap explorer DOM rows, reduce animation
  work, and suppress expensive dense-graph effects.
- The duplicate global Recall shortcut was removed from the dashboard header. Recall
  remains available in the Memory Operations sidebar and from contextual page actions.
- The README documentation was expanded to clarify note-link graphs, agent memory, code
  awareness, encryption, and sleep-time consolidation without making unmeasured product
  comparisons.
- The README now documents Command Code CLI as an MCP-native client and includes its
  verified stdio registration command.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-07-18

Hardening release focused on dependable installation, upgrades, startup, dashboard use,
and safe hosted deployment.

### Security

- Every entrypoint sends baseline response headers: CSP, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and HSTS over HTTPS
  only. Override with `ENGRAPHIS_CSP` / `ENGRAPHIS_HSTS`; set either to an empty string to
  omit that header where a fronting proxy supplies its own.
- Loopback/bootstrap trust now rejects all common forwarding metadata, including
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`; a same-host TLS proxy can no longer make an internet request
  look like an unproxied local setup request.
- Inspector first-admin setup now uses the auth store's atomic empty-database gate, so
  concurrent different-email requests cannot both create administrators.

### Added

- MCP clients now receive canonical recall, session, durable-memory, and handoff guidance
  through the server's initialization instructions.
- The dashboard exposes a small `/api` service index, and the graph CLI documents its
  public commands without showing the internal merge-driver command.
- Regression coverage now exercises the sqlite-vec backend, workspace-aware entity recall,
  installed database migration, encryption packaging, CLI startup, update paths, and release
  artifacts.

### Changed

- Installed builds now keep the default database in the platform user-data directory.
  Existing package-directory databases are copied with SQLite's backup API, validated, and
  preserved as recovery copies; source checkouts retain their repository-local default.
- `engraphis-update` discovers the highest stable SemVer tag, validates explicit versions,
  fails closed on fetch errors, refuses dirty editable worktrees, and keeps pip, pipx, Git,
  and documents the source-rebuild path for locally built Docker images.
- Dashboard styling and navigation were reworked with five selectable themes, responsive
  mobile behavior, semantic landmarks, improved keyboard focus, clearer confirmations, and
  fully self-hosted browser assets.
- Console launchers now validate arguments before optional imports, report actionable startup
  failures, display reachable IPv4/IPv6 URLs and resolved database paths, and advertise the
  current dashboard and API routes.
- Optional-dependency bounds and extras were refreshed. The cross-platform `all` extra no
  longer pulls the platform-limited SQLCipher driver, while encryption continues to fail
  closed when no compatible driver is available.
- The release workflow now pins actions by commit, runs the full test/evaluation and package
  validation gates, matches release tags to package versions, and reserves publishing for
  validated tag pushes. Bundled browser-library license notices are included in distributions.
- Installation, hosting, sync, graph-query, MCP tool-count, and database-location guidance was
  synchronized with the current commands and runtime behavior.

### Fixed

- Installed `engraphis-init` configuration is now loaded from the current directory's
  `.env` without parent traversal, while explicit environment variables retain precedence.
  Upgrading no longer opens a fresh platform-default database instead of the database the
  user selected through `engraphis-init`.
- A failed dashboard memory-detail request can no longer retain a prior memory identity or
  leave write controls enabled, preventing a later Save from modifying the wrong memory.
- A fresh hosted deployment now renders an actionable, non-data bootstrap screen when remote
  API access is denied by default; it offers the safe Team-trial path or deployment-variable
  setup without exposing account-wide license activation to a signed-out browser.
- Dashboard, REST, Inspector, MCP, licensing, sync, billing, and provider failures now return
  bounded user-facing messages rather than raw exceptions or upstream response bodies.
- Trusted-proxy handling now evaluates the rightmost forwarded hop, supports exact/CIDR
  allow-lists, and prevents untrusted forwarding headers from changing URLs or secure-cookie
  decisions. Interactive API documentation is disabled on user-facing servers by default.
- Dashboard handlers now read memory, workspace, member, and token identifiers from escaped
  `data-*` attributes instead of interpolating untrusted values into inline JavaScript.
- Repository-graph JSON output now escapes non-ASCII labels so Windows console encodings do
  not turn successful `impact`, `prs`, or query commands into exit-code 2 failures.
- A server-only installation now includes the multipart parser required by dashboard import
  routes instead of depending on the unrelated MCP extra to provide it transitively.
- `engraphis-mcp --help` works without importing the optional MCP stack; server-only and
  explicitly offline configurations no longer emit misleading missing-dependency warnings.
- Dashboard and legacy-server launch failures retain database recovery details instead of
  collapsing them into generic errors, and invalid port values are rejected cleanly.
- SQLite vector selection is now tested in both accelerated and offline-fallback modes, while
  memory writes remain durable and audited if an index update fails.
- The zero-configuration Compose dashboard now admits its Docker host bridge while both
  published ports remain loopback-only; widening a port requires an API token.
- Git-installed updates retain their recorded PEP 610 remote, and failed editable updates
  restore the original branch without exposing a Python traceback.
- Customer-operated sync relays are separated from the managed license/trial/invite service,
  and the sample `.env` no longer overrides installed database defaults with a relative path.
- MCP end-of-session guidance again represents completed work with an empty unresolved list
  instead of persisting a fake open thread.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-07-17

### Security
- Team-mode login gained a per-source-IP failure throttle (25 failures / 15 min)
  alongside the existing per-email lockout, closing the credential-stuffing sweep
  that tried each address once; lockouts now surface as a typed
  `AccountLockedError` mapped to HTTP 429 + `Retry-After` (previously 401, or a
  429 derived by substring-matching the error message).

### Fixed
- `remember`/`remember_with_resolution` are now atomic across the neighbor-resolve →
  insert sequence (engine-level write lock): concurrent near-duplicate writes can no
  longer both resolve ADD and store duplicates instead of NOOP/INVALIDATE.
- The Inspector's `/api/auth/login`/`setup` no longer run PBKDF2 (600k iterations)
  on the asyncio event loop; password hashing moved to a worker thread, so a burst
  of logins can't stall every other request.
- A failed vector-index upsert on the write path is now logged and audited
  (`index_upsert_failed`) instead of silently swallowed. Previously, the memory
  stayed invisible to semantic recall with no trace.
- URLs built from a bind host are now IPv6-safe and connectable (`engraphis.netutil`):
  `ENGRAPHIS_HOST=::` no longer yields the malformed `http://:::8700` in the printed
  dashboard URL, the :8710 redirector target, or `Settings.base_url`; wildcard binds
  map to loopback.
- The Docker image no longer bakes an IPv4-only bind: the entrypoint defaults
  `ENGRAPHIS_HOST` to dual-stack `::` when the kernel has IPv6 (what Railway's
  private-network healthchecks require) and `0.0.0.0` otherwise, so wiping the
  service's env vars can't regress the 2026-07-16 healthcheck outage.

### Changed
- Consolidated four per-app bearer-token checks into one constant-time
  `inspector.auth.bearer_ok` helper (scheme now matched case-insensitively per
  RFC 7235 everywhere); extracted the ~230-line code-graph HTML/Markdown export
  templates from `core/engine.py` into `core/codegraph_export.py`; documented the
  v1/v2 split in `engraphis/routes/__init__`; entity ancestor-widening in graph
  recall now applies to `workspace_id` symmetrically with `repo_id`; filtered
  sqlite-vec searches cap their geometric widening with a single full scan.

### Added
- Schema v3 logical graph layers (`temporal`, `entity`, `causal`, `semantic`), privacy-safe
  SHA-256 receipt chains, optional LLM/host retention supervision, and a persistent code↔memory
  bridge.
- Incremental multi-language repository indexing (Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C/C++,
  SQL, Terraform), docstrings/comments, variables, inheritance/implementation, weighted
  communities, hotspots, path queries, git/PR impact analysis, portable JSON/HTML/Markdown
  exports, and a graph union merge driver.
- Local multi-format resource ingestion for text/code/HTML/DOCX, optional PDF/image OCR and
  faster-whisper transcription, plus live PostgreSQL schema introspection with DSN redaction.
- Seven MCP tools for code paths/impact/export, PostgreSQL schema ingestion, and receipt
  list/verify/export, bringing the tool surface from 20 to 27.
- `engraphis-graph` workflow CLI and token-protected `engraphis-graph-server` read-only HTTP
  surface.

### Changed
- Railway hosting now supports Pro solo single-admin deployments: any active Pro or Team
  entitlement can bootstrap the first admin and activates the login wall, while member
  seats and direct hosted agent writes remain Team-only. The hosting guide now covers both
  Pro solo sync-relay and Team member flows.

### Fixed
- 1-hop graph recall (and the PPR large-graph fallback) now honors `graph_layers`, matching
  the PPR arm: `Store.neighbors()` gained a `layers` filter.
- `FolderTransport.push()` no longer follows peer-planted symlinks in the shared sync folder
  (unpredictable temp name + `O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`), closing an arbitrary-file-write
  vector that mirrored the already-hardened read side.
- `engraphis-graph-server` treats an empty `--host`/`ENGRAPHIS_GRAPH_HOST` as non-loopback
  (it binds all interfaces), so the bearer-token requirement can no longer be skipped.
- Caller-supplied `metadata.retention_supervision` is stripped at the service boundary; only
  the validated `retention_class` presets can influence importance/stability.
- `merge_workspaces()` no longer duplicates symbols/code edges when both workspaces indexed
  the same file in a same-named repo: the losing snapshot's rows are cleared, and its
  memory↔code links are re-pointed at the surviving same-fqname symbols.
- `engraphis-graph impact/prs` reject leading-dash git revisions (git option injection), and
  graph exports refuse a symlinked output directory and are written atomically without
  following pre-planted symlinks.
- The unified graph endpoint bounds entity edges and code edges/links per request
  (`limit`-derived cap) so a large workspace graph or indexed repo can't produce unbounded
  viewer-role responses.
- Relay sync fails closed when a workspace's settings are unreadable rather than treating a
  possibly-personal folder as shared: in the sync CLI and in the dashboard/background
  `_sync_all` path; resource extraction enforces its own raw-size cap.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Agent Connect for hosted Team instances.** Members can mint SHA-256-hashed per-user
  bearer tokens in Settings and use the hosted v2 store through `POST /api/remember`,
  the existing read routes, token management under `/api/auth/token*`, and
  `GET /api/auth/connect-info`. Tokens retain the user's role and personal-folder scope;
  viewers are read-only and disabling a user invalidates their tokens immediately.
- **Authenticated MCP-over-HTTP at `/mcp`.** When the MCP extra is installed, the
  dashboard mounts the same 20 tools as the standalone server and injects its existing
  `MemoryService`, avoiding a second SQLite writer. The endpoint requires an active Team
  entitlement and per-user bearer token, enforces viewer/member/admin roles per tool, and
  reports actual mount availability through connect-info.
- **One-click Railway hosting.** Added `railway.json`, the README deploy button, and
  `docs/HOSTING_RAILWAY.md` for persistent volumes, forwarded HTTPS headers, Team
  entitlement bootstrap, member invites, and HTTP/MCP agent connection.
- **Two new MCP context tools.** The MCP inventory grows from 18 to 20 with
  `engraphis_answer`, a compatibility alias for the existing grounded-recall contract,
  and `engraphis_proactive_context`, also available at `POST /api/proactive-context`.
  Proactive packets include bounded task/agent state, cited memories, suggested queries,
  and the previous session handoff. Optional LLM prose is accepted only when every claim
  carries a valid citation.
- **Structured LLM ingestion and consolidation.** `ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=llm_structured`
  validates typed facts, entities, relations, keywords, and confidence; that metadata is
  preserved through storage and automatically feeds the graph. Settings now includes a
  **Connect your LLM** card backed by `/api/llm/status` and `/api/llm/test`.
  Consolidation adds schema-validated facts and explicit source supersession across the
  service, REST, MCP, and CLI surfaces, with deterministic fallback on provider/schema
  failure.
- **Opt-in deterministic memory intelligence APIs.** Added conflict triage for duplicate,
  refinement, contradiction, and obsolete candidates, plus a serializable `UserModel`
  that learns interaction preferences and reranks recall results. These helpers do not
  mutate the store or alter default recall unless a caller invokes them.

### Changed
- **Team mode is opt-out by default.** `ENGRAPHIS_TEAM_MODE=0` (or false/no/off) disables
  Team plumbing. A fresh solo install stays open, first-admin setup requires a live Team
  entitlement, and an existing team's authentication wall remains active if its license
  lapses so private data never becomes public.
- Pre-login license status and trial routes now allow a fresh instance to start a Team
  trial before first-admin setup. Purchased keys bootstrap through
  `ENGRAPHIS_LICENSE_KEY` or the license file; `/api/license/activate` remains admin-only.
- Package fallback metadata and all user-facing tool inventories now agree on version
  `0.9.6` and 20 MCP tools.

### Fixed
- **Agent Connect and dashboard lifecycle:** corrected generated endpoint URLs, retained
  one-time token visibility, made `/mcp` bearer-only, bound MCP sessions to their initiating
  user, rechecked tool roles on every call, retained DNS-rebinding protection, closed
  previously injected stores, and made connect-info reflect the real optional MCP mount.
- **License and Team enforcement:** authoritative revocations override cached entitlement
  and persist tombstones for previously unrecorded keys; transient failures may use only
  an unexpired lease; public license/trial bootstrap routes close after the first Team user;
  trial rate limits trust forwarded addresses only from configured proxies; managed
  requests use explicit client headers; retired managed relay URLs are canonicalized
  across key issuance, license/trial, invite, and sync clients; and configured keys
  that fall back to free after transient outages retry automatically.
- **Python and packaging compatibility:** rate-limit buckets and audit exports use
  timezone-aware UTC APIs, package metadata uses the SPDX license format, and the
  deterministic fallback matches the default embedding model’s 384 dimensions.
- **Memory and retrieval integrity:** audit writes are committed durably, recall excludes
  non-live rows, mixed embedding dimensions no longer crash recall and have a backed-up
  repair path, sync enforces workspace/repository boundaries in both directions, graph
  provenance is pruned per memory instead of deleting shared edges, SQLite-vector distances
  are converted to cosine similarity, entity expansion matches complete names, and the
  sentence-transformers adapters support both legacy and renamed dimension APIs.
- **Structured-data safety:** extraction metadata survives ingest unchanged, proactive and
  consolidation inputs are bounded, structured consolidation rejects source IDs outside
  the requested cluster, and synthesized context cannot replace deterministic output
  without valid citations.
- **Dashboard graph navigation:** focusing an isolated node now retains the requested node
  through the delayed renderer retry instead of reporting a false “Entity not in view.”
- **Dashboard typography:** replaced sub-12px text and the flat type ramp with a consistent
  12/16/24/32px hierarchy while preserving responsive layout.

### Documentation
- Updated the README, Agent Connect, Railway, Kilo Code, bundled memory skill, benchmark
  command, and package-version fallback to match the shipped routes, tool count, setup
  order, and extractor/consolidation options; removed the unused shortcut icon helper.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Team mode is now ON by default (opt-out).** `ENGRAPHIS_TEAM_MODE` defaults to on;
  set `ENGRAPHIS_TEAM_MODE=0` (or false/no/off) to disable. The per-user login wall is
  no longer raised just because the mode flag is on. It now requires a *live* `team`
  feature entitlement (`licensing.has_feature("team")`), checked at request time in
  `dashboard_app.py` and reflected in `/api/auth/state`. Solo / no-license installs stay
  fully open, and the wall appears the moment a team license key is added, even via the
  dashboard UI at runtime. A `team` license is still required to *add seats* beyond the
  first admin (bootstrap admin is created unconditionally). Docs (`.env.example`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `scripts/init.py`) and team-mode test fixtures
  updated.
- **Team-invite email rewritten to separate "join" from "activate a key".** The old
  invite conflated the two, so members pasted the shared team key into the hosted/Railway
  dashboard, saw it "work" (it just re-activated a license already active there), and
  thought they'd joined, when joining means signing in with email + password. The email
  now frames two distinct options: **Option 1** (required to join) sign in to the team
  dashboard with email + the admin-set password, with explicitly *no license key needed here,
  don't paste one*; **Option 2** (optional) run Engraphis on your own machine and access
  the team's memories locally; that is what the shared team key is for (LOCAL
  `http://127.0.0.1:8700` → Settings → License, then Settings → Cloud Sync to pull the
  converged team store down to a local offline copy). Invites now always carry a
  clickable sign-in link: `dashboard_url` resolves explicit arg → `ENGRAPHIS_DASHBOARD_URL`
  → `DEFAULT_TEAM_DASHBOARD_URL` (`https://team.engraphis.com/`). A footer with the
  canonical site + repo links is added as env-overridable module constants
  (`SITE_URL`/`REPO_URL`) so the URLs can't drift per-email. `tests/test_billing.py`.

### Fixed
- **Intermittent `database is locked` from `set_service`.** `routes/v2_api.set_service`
  swapped the global `MemoryService` without closing the previously-bound service's store
  connection, so under heavy test churn a deferred-GC close of the old SQLite/WAL handle
  collided with the next `MemoryService.create` on the same path. The prior store is now
  closed on swap (best-effort, never blocks the swap on a close error).

### Docs
- **README now documents three previously-undocumented shipped features** (the features
  themselves shipped in 0.9.3): sub-file chunking (`ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=chunk` + the
  `eval.chunking_eval` whole-file-vs-chunked harness), auto-dreaming (the background
  cross-cluster-inference loop, accumulation + idle trigger, `dream_inference`
  provenance/auditability), and every automation dream knob exposed via the dashboard
  Automation tab and the `GET/POST /automation` + `POST /maintenance/run` API. Also: a
  **Team early-access beta** callout (top + feature/pricing tables + Free-vs-Pro section)
  and a **daily-update reminder for maintainers** near the top (code wins; fix the doc in
  the same change).

### Chore
- `.gitignore` now excludes `automation.json` / `autosync.json` (regenerable local
  runtime state from `engraphis/automation.py`, not source content).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **The dashboard (`engraphis-dashboard` / `http://127.0.0.1:8700`) would not start.**
  `scripts/start_dashboard.py` runs uvicorn against `engraphis.dashboard_app:app`, but
  `dashboard_app.py` only defined the `create_app()` factory and never built a module-level
  `app` instance, so uvicorn aborted with `Attribute "app" not found` and nothing bound
  port 8700. The missing `app = create_app()` (present in `engraphis/app.py` and
  `engraphis/redirector.py`, but dropped from `dashboard_app.py`) is now restored. The
  background autosync/dreaming/revalidation loops inside `create_app()` are pytest-guarded,
  so importing the module under test is side-effect-free.
- **Flaky `database is locked` dashboard test.**
  `test_consolidate_inference_pass_is_pro_gated` opened two FastAPI `TestClient` lifespans
  back-to-back on the same temp DB file; the first app's still-open SQLite connection
  blocked the second's schema init. Split into two one-client test functions, matching
  the convention already documented above `test_analytics_and_export_*` (two TestClients
  in one test reproducibly deadlock). Full suite now green (693 passed, 3 skipped).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Email-verified self-serve trial + abuse protections on the trial endpoint.**
  Starting a trial now requires a verified email and sends a one-time confirmation link
  before any license is issued; the request path is rate-limited so the endpoint can't be
  used to spam or farm trials. This raises the bar significantly above the previous
  device-only gate while keeping the same paste-a-key activation flow on the dashboard.
  `tests/test_cloud_license.py`, `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`,
  `tests/test_online_only_enforcement.py`.
- **Deterministic, offline sub-file chunking on the write path (`ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=chunk`).**
  A third `Extractor` alongside passthrough/LLM: `ChunkingExtractor` splits a document into
  retrieval-sized `ExtractedFact` chunks that preserve meaning: markdown headings start new
  chunks and become the title, fenced code blocks stay intact, prose is packed to a token
  budget (`ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_TOKENS`, default 256) with a sentence-level overlap
  (`ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_OVERLAP`, default 32); a hard per-document cap
  (`ENGRAPHIS_CHUNK_MAX`, default 200) bounds amplification. numpy/stdlib only, so it runs
  under the offline gate and is byte-identical across runs. This gives long, multi-topic
  documents finer retrieval units instead of one diluted memory; the bundled evaluation below
  preserves Recall@5 while reducing retrieved context. New: `ChunkingExtractor` in
  `backends/extractor.py`; `tests/test_chunking_extractor.py`.
- **File/folder imports chunk too.** With `ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=chunk`,
  `import_folder`/`import_files` split each file into several retrieval-sized memories
  (each still `trusted:false`, stamped with `metadata.chunk={index,of,heading}`) instead of
  one; the LLM extractor is deliberately never applied to the local import path (no external
  calls on untrusted disk files). A file still counts as one imported unit.
  `tests/test_import_chunking.py`.
- **Chunking eval + `longdoc` dataset.** `eval/chunking_eval.py` +
  `eval/datasets/longdoc.jsonl` compare whole-file vs chunked ingestion through the real
  recall pipeline. On the offline embedder: identical recall@5 (1.000) at **~73% fewer
  context tokens** (809 → 219) and ~4× smaller tokens-to-evidence (162 → 42); the "quality per token"
  number `BENCHMARKS.md` calls for. `tests/test_chunking_eval.py`.
- **"Dreaming" trigger for automated maintenance.** `automation.should_dream` / `dream_due`
  run a consolidation sweep *before* the cadence when enough new episodic memories have
  accumulated **and** the store has gone quiet (`dream_min_new` / `dream_idle_minutes` policy
  knobs); wired into `scripts/auto_maintain.py`. Purely additive to the existing cadence, so
  cron behaviour is unchanged; still Pro-gated. `tests/test_dreaming_trigger.py`.
- **Associative cross-cluster inference (dream pass 4).** `consolidate.infer_links` /
  `consolidate(infer=True)` proposes evidence-only links between memories in *different,
  dissimilar* subject clusters that share a bridging entity: the "connect distant dots" step
  same-subject distillation never reaches. **Off by default** (`infer=False`); the pass
  follows the sweep's own `dry_run` flag, so a dry-run proposes into the report and a real
  run applies. Applied inferences are low-salience (`importance=0.25`), `trusted:false`,
  `source='dream_inference'`, linked to their sources and audited, so a bad inference is
  visible, downweighted, and never merge-eligible into a trusted fact. Fan-out capped,
  idempotent. Entity matching is now word-boundary (so `Redis` won't fire on
  `rediscovered`) and the per-sweep text scan is computed once, not per entity.
  `tests/test_inference.py`.
- **Inference is reachable from the maintenance path.** A new `infer` policy knob (off
  by default) runs the inference pass inside `run_maintenance`, whether manual or from the dream loop,
  following the sweep's `dry_run`. `/api/consolidate` takes `infer` (`false` by default);
  `/api/automation` round-trips `infer`; the dashboard Automation tab has an Inference
  toggle. `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py` (policy round-trip + `/maintenance/run` proposes the
  Redis bridge), `tests/test_dashboard_dream_ui.py`.
- **Dreaming runs without cron.** A dashboard background loop (`_maybe_start_dreaming`,
  mirroring auto-sync) runs a maintenance sweep whenever `automation.dream_due` fires. It is opt-in,
  Pro-gated, fault-isolated, with an `ENGRAPHIS_DREAM_LOOP=0` kill switch. The `/api/automation`
  policy round-trips the `dream` / `dream_min_new` / `dream_idle_minutes` knobs, and the
  dashboard's Automation tab surfaces them as form controls (toggle + thresholds). The
  trigger now scopes its accumulation/idle count to the policy's `workspaces` (a burst in
  an out-of-scope workspace no longer fires a sweep). `tests/test_dreaming_trigger.py`,
  `tests/test_dashboard_dream_ui.py`, `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`.

### Fixed
- **First-run team-mode bootstrap hardened.** The admin-creation path no longer depends
  on an external relay round-trip succeeding to provision the first seat, and concurrent
  first-admin requests are serialized so only one unlicensed bootstrap admin can ever be
  created. Subsequent seat additions still require an active Team license.
- **First-run team-mode bootstrap fixed (frontend).** The admin-account screen now triggers
  the trial/activation step before provisioning the first admin, so a fresh self-hosted
  instance no longer deadlocks on the team-feature gate with no way to proceed.
  No backend change; frontend-only.
- `MemoryService.create` now defaults `extractor` from `settings.extractor`
  (`ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR`) when unset, mirroring the existing `graph_extractor` fallback so
  the dashboard and automated-maintenance front ends honor the config knob, not just the MCP
  server and CLI. An explicit `extractor="none"` still overrides the environment.

### Security
- **Closed a Pro-feature bypass on the manual consolidate endpoint.** The inference pass
  (a paid capability) was reachable through the free housekeeping endpoint without a
  license; it is now gated at the route and reinforced inside the service layer, so no
  caller can reach the Pro-only path without a server-approved license. The free manual
  consolidate action is unchanged. `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`, `tests/test_inference.py`.
- **Strengthened license enforcement and revocation handling.** Reaffirmed that every paid
  surface requires a live, server-validated lease and fails closed when the server is
  unreachable; tightened the verification so licenses can't be forged client-side, and
  serverside-issued seats can't be minted without a valid license. Revoked or refunded keys
  are now re-confirmed against the server on a background interval so they degrade promptly
  rather than remaining usable until lease expiry, while legitimate offline customers are
  never stalled. `tests/test_online_only_enforcement.py`, `tests/test_cloud_license.py`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Personal vs. shared folders + a redesigned Team dashboard.** A folder can now be
  created `visibility='personal'` (owned by, and visible/usable only to, the creating
  dashboard user) or `shared` (the whole team, the previous, still-default behaviour).
  Enforcement runs through a single workspace-authorization chokepoint, so every scoped
  read/write inherits it and a non-owner cannot access another user's personal folder.
  Personal folders are excluded from relay sync so they stay on-device. The **Team
  dashboard** gains a team overview (seat usage + activity), a Folders panel that creates
  and manages shared/personal folders (folder creation now lives here: the Workspaces
  tab is selection-only in team mode), members with last-active, and a team audit log with
  CSV export. New/updated: `service.py`, `routes/v2_api.py`, `dashboard_app.py`,
  `static/index.html`; tests in `tests/test_personal_folders.py`,
  `tests/test_dashboard_v2.py`, `tests/test_sync_dashboard.py`.

### Changed
- README expanded with the missing features (cloud sync, encryption, import/ingest,
  workspace ops, Docker, config, and more) and now links to the Engraphis Discord.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Automatic v1→v2 database migration on startup**: a pre-existing v1-shaped
  `engraphis.db` (no `workspace_id` column) is backed up and migrated to the v2
  schema, so existing installs upgrade cleanly without manual SQL.

### Fixed
- **Dockerfile default entrypoint** is now `engraphis-dashboard --no-open` (was the v1
  single-user `engraphis-server`), so a fresh container serves a working team dashboard
  with auth/license/trial routes instead of a permanently signed-out UI.
  `engraphis-server` remains available as an explicit override for single-user
  deployments.
- **CI**: ruff lint errors and core-floor (numpy-only) test collection.
  fastapi-dependent tests now skip cleanly on the minimal core floor. `loads_strict`
  now rejects pathologically deep JSON on every Python version (3.12's JSON scanner
  no longer raises RecursionError for ~1000-deep input, which had broken the
  deep-nesting parsing guard and its test on 3.12).

## [0.8.8] - 2026-07-13

### Security

- Improved offline trial tamper resistance

## [0.8.7] - 2026-07-12

## [0.8.6] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Dashboard "Import files & folders" section restored on v2 engine
  (`engraphis/service.py`, `routes/v2_api.py`, `static/index.html`, Workspaces tab)
- Server-side path import and drag-and-drop upload, both member-gated and bounded
- Imported memories marked untrusted by default; 21 new tests

### Security
- Hardened folder import against path-traversal and containment bypasses

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Logout no longer re-triggers sign-in modal loop
- Team bootstrap: trial/license endpoints now accessible before first admin exists
- Expired/revoked Team license no longer locks out all logins
- Trial start now idempotent (no 400 on repeated calls mid-trial)
- Team trial grants 5 seats (was 1), enabling actual team evaluation
- Dashboard handles empty workspaces gracefully
- Static assets (dashboard HTML, vendor JS) now ship correctly in wheel

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-12

### Security
- Paid features now require a live, server-issued license lease
- Offline handling degrades gracefully with bounded grace when the server is unreachable
- Local/offline trial grants removed; trials are server-issued and tracked per device
- Issued keys are server-enforced by default

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Empty workspace `/api/memories` returns `[]` instead of 500
- Online-only license enforcement: cloud-mode keys validated per request

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Static package discovery: `engraphis/static/__init__.py` added
- Vendor glob: recursive pattern so `static/vendor/` bundles ship in wheel
- Dashboard 500 on `GET /`: `static/index.html` was missing from wheel (packaging bug)
- Dashboard 500 on fresh install: `GET /api/memories` crashed on empty workspace
