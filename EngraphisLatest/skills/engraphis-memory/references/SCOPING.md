# Scoping: `workspace → repo → session → memory`

Scoping is the highest-leverage decision in Engraphis. Every write sets a scope; every read is
filtered by one. Get it right and memories surface exactly when useful; get it wrong and they
either appear in unrelated work or never come back. Scope is a work-context boundary, not a
human identity boundary.

## Two orthogonal axes: don't conflate them

| Axis | Question it answers | Values | Set by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **scope** | *Where does this apply?* | `session` · `repo` · `workspace` | `scope=` on `remember` |
| **type** (`mtype`) | *What kind of thing is this?* | `working` · `episodic` · `semantic` · `procedural` | `mtype=` on `remember` |

A convention is `mtype="semantic"` and probably `scope="repo"`. A personal preference has no
safe memory scope yet: `user` is reserved until memories carry an immutable owner identity. Type
is covered in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md); this file is about scope.

## The hierarchy

```
workspace            org or product        ("acme")          : every write belongs to one
  └─ repo            a repository          ("backend")       : omit only for workspace-wide facts
       └─ session    one unit of work      (session_id)      : from engraphis_session(action="start")
            └─ memory                                         : the fact itself
```

Names are **stable identifiers**, not prose. Reuse the exact same `workspace`/`repo` strings every
time: recall filters match on them literally. Pick the repository's canonical name for `repo`
(what you'd `git clone`), and a durable org/product name for `workspace`.

## Choose the workspace for this work

Use an explicit user or project workspace choice when one is provided. Session starts can omit
`workspace` to use the saved mapping for their `repo`, with `default` as the fallback. Routine
remember and recall calls first resolve an omitted workspace from an authorized supplied
`session_id`, then the saved repo mapping. Without either, writes use `default`; recall with a
repo but no mapping also uses `default`. Local recall with no workspace, repo, or session retains
its broad search behavior.

Explicit workspace values, including `"default"`, win over saved mappings. A workspace or repo
that conflicts with a supplied session is rejected. Invalid or unauthorized sessions never
fall back. Starting a session does not create a server-global current workspace: retain the
returned `session_id` and pass it on later calls. The session response names the destination.

Use the dashboard's connection setup to save a repo-to-workspace mapping and copy project
instructions, or discover the corresponding project-routing capability. Authenticated callers
have separate saved mappings; standalone local clients share the local mapping. The dashboard
workspace selector alone does not change an agent's arguments. A changed mapping affects future
calls that use it, while existing sessions keep their original destination.

Use stable workspace names by client, product, or area of work. The four memory types describe
the memory, not its routing: changing `mtype` never moves it to another workspace. Reorganize
existing records through an explicit, previewed move rather than changing routing and assuming
past memories moved too. See the repo's `docs/WORKSPACE_ORGANIZATION.md` for the full workflow.

## What each scope means

- **`session`**: visible only within one session. Transient working state ("currently editing the
  auth refactor on branch X"). Ends with the session.
- **`repo`**: the default, and the right answer most of the time. Facts true for one repository:
  conventions, decisions, bug fixes. Requires a `repo`.
- **`workspace`**: true across every repo in the org/product: shared standards, cross-repo
  architecture, team norms. Set `repo=None`.
- **`user`**: reserved and rejected for new writes. Memories do not yet persist an owner identity,
  so `user` cannot provide per-human isolation or follow one person across workspaces. Historical
  `user` rows remain workspace-bound for compatibility and must not be treated as private.

## Choose the narrowest scope that stays reusable

Ask: *where would I want this to resurface?* Then scope there, no wider.

- A fix for a quirk in `backend` only → `scope="repo"`.
- "The whole org uses trunk-based dev" → `scope="workspace"`.
- Personal preferences → do not persist until owner-bound user scope exists.
- "I'm mid-way through step 3 of this task" → `scope="session"` (or just an `open_thread`).

Over-scoping (everything `workspace`) pollutes recall in unrelated repos. Under-scoping (everything
`session`) means nothing survives the task. When unsure between `repo` and `workspace`, start at
`repo`. Promoting later is cheap; retracting a leaked fact is not.

## Sessions and handoff

A session groups a task's memories and enables resume. On the default Smart MCP surface:

1. `engraphis_session(action="start", workspace, repo, agent, goal)` returns `session_id`, `reused`, and a
   `bootstrap` carrying the previous same-user/agent session's `summary` + `open_threads` for this
   repo.
2. Pass `session_id` to direct `engraphis_remember` during the task. For an episodic event, first
   discover the record-event capability and pass that same `session_id` to its returned executor.
3. `engraphis_session(action="end", session_id, summary, outcome, open_threads)`: `open_threads` are the
   unresolved items; they auto-surface for the next same-user/agent session in this repo.

`engraphis_start_session` and `engraphis_end_session` are the corresponding Classic-only names
for pinned legacy integrations.

Starting is idempotent per exact `(workspace, repo, authenticated user, agent, goal)` identity.
Different users, agents, or goals automatically open separate sessions. `reused=true` therefore
means a retry found the same active task. Use `force_new=true` only to branch a second session when
every identity field matches; use this escape hatch deliberately because parallel duplicate task
sessions make ownership and handoff ambiguous.

An authenticated host integration must bind both a stable non-empty user `id` and an ownership
`email`. A malformed non-`None` principal is rejected; it never collapses into an anonymous or
legacy owner. `None` is reserved for trusted standalone/system operation with no user boundary.

Use sessions for any multi-step task. `open_threads` is how the next agent avoids re-discovering
where you stopped.

## Promotion (widening scope)

A learning often starts narrow (a session observation) and proves durable. Promote the existing
memory with `engraphis_promote(memory_id, target_scope, workspace, repo?, reason?)`:

- Session note that turns out to be a real repo convention → `target_scope="repo"`.
- Repo fact that turns out to hold org-wide → `target_scope="workspace"`.

Promotion must be strictly wider. Engraphis writes/deduplicates the wider record first, then
bi-temporally closes the narrow source and links them with `promotes`; pinning, sensitivity,
provenance, and learned stability are inherited. Automatic promotion is not assumed: promote
deliberately when evidence shows the learning applies more broadly.

Promotion to `user` and new `user`-scope writes are not supported: current records have no
immutable owner identity and remain workspace-bound. Use `repo`, `workspace`, or `session`;
never label shared workspace storage as a private personal scope.

## Reads are scoped too

`engraphis_recall` is hierarchy-aware. A repo context sees that repo plus its workspace ancestors;
a session context sees that exact session plus its repo/workspace ancestors. Other sessions never
leak into repo/workspace recall. Historical `user` rows can still appear as workspace ancestors
for compatibility; they are not owner-isolated. Routine MCP calls can resolve the workspace from
their session or repo mapping as described above. If recall returns no results and a `note` says
the workspace/repo is unknown, you simply have not written there yet. An unknown `session_id`
is an error when `workspace` is omitted. With an explicit workspace, an unknown session returns
no memories and a `note`, without broadening the search. Unauthorized sessions and conflicts
between a known session and the supplied workspace or repo remain errors.
