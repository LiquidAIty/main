# Engraphis MCP tools: reference

The Classic server registers 39 direct tools and the Smart gateway registers nine; two names
overlap, for 46 distinct public tool names. Parameters are `name (type, default)`: no default
means required. Every tool returns a JSON string; on failure it returns `"Error: <reason>"`
instead of raising.
Governance tools (`retire`/`pin`/`correct`/`link`) verify the memory actually belongs to the
`workspace`/`repo` you pass **before** changing anything, so you can't touch memories outside a
scope you were already given.

## Write

### `engraphis_remember`
Store a memory so it can be recalled later, across turns, sessions, and repos.

- `content (str)`: the fact/decision/convention/procedure.
- `workspace (str, None)`: top-level scope (org/product), e.g. `"acme"`. Omitted inherits an
  authorized supplied session, then a saved repo mapping, then `"default"`. Explicit values
  override mappings; a workspace/repo mismatch with a supplied session is rejected.
- `repo (str, None)`: repository scope; omit for workspace-wide facts.
- `session_id (str, None)`: from `engraphis_start_session`, if this belongs to a session.
- `mtype (str, "semantic")`: `semantic` | `episodic` | `procedural` | `working`. See CONVENTIONS.
- `scope (str, None)`: `session` | `repo` | `workspace`; `user` is reserved and rejected until
  memories carry an immutable owner identity. Omitted preserves the compatible default (`repo`
  when `repo` or a repo-backed `session_id` is present, otherwise `workspace`). Session
  visibility must be explicit. See SCOPING.
- `title (str, "")`: optional short title.
- `importance (float, 0.0)`: `0..1`; higher resists decay.
- `keywords (list[str], None)`: optional, aids lexical recall.
- `dedupe (bool, True)`: check against similar existing memories first: an exact restatement
  **reinforces** the existing one (`op:"noop"`); a keyed or strongly evidenced update
  **supersedes** the old one (`op:"invalidate"`, old closed not deleted); an uncertain neighbor
  returns `op:"relate"` and keeps both. Set `False` only for intentionally repeated episodic
  log entries.
- `source (str, "agent")`: content origin. Web, import, sync, and other external origins remain
  untrusted even if `trusted=true`.
- `trusted (bool, true)`: local-agent confidence label; it cannot elevate an external origin.
- `kind (str, None)`: optional artifact kind such as `plan`, `diff`, `review`, or `task_summary`.
- `retention_class (str, None)`: optional host classification: `ephemeral` | `normal` |
  `critical`; advisory and bounded, never a silent discard.
- `retention_reason (str, "")`: short content-free rationale for that classification.
- `valid_from (float, None)`: optional Unix timestamp for when the fact became true in
  world time; omit to use ingestion time.
- `subject_key (str, "")`: optional stable claim subject, such as `api.rate_limit`.
- `claim_kind (str, "")`: optional predicate/category, such as `configured_value`. A matching
  subject and compatible kind make supersession deterministic; uncertain neighbors remain live.
- `exact_value (str, None)`: optional literal that must occur verbatim in the source content;
  use this when a downstream edit or tool argument must preserve an exact value.
- `exact_value_type (str, "literal")`: `literal` | `string` | `identifier` | `path` | `number` |
  `date` | `enum` | `json`. Ambiguous repeated values require a source span through the
  Python/service API.

Returns `{id, workspace, workspace_source, repo, scope, mtype, stored:true, op}` where
`workspace_source` is `explicit` | `session` | `project` | `default`, and `op` is `add` | `noop` |
`invalidate` (with `superseded:[old_id,…]`) | `relate` (with `related_to`; both claims remain) |
`quarantined` (retained for governance review but excluded from normal recall, with content-free
`policy` and `reasons` codes).

> Prefer `dedupe=True` (default). It is what keeps the store contradiction-free without an LLM.

### `engraphis_remember_many`
Store a batch of facts from parallel agents (fan-out sub-agents, a research sweep, a review
council) in one atomic, deduplicated write, instead of many separate `remember` calls.

- `facts (list[dict])`: each item needs `content` and optionally `title`, `mtype`,
  `importance` (0..1), `keywords`, `metadata`, `subject_key`, `claim_kind`,
  `valid_from` (Unix timestamp), `exact_value`, `exact_value_type`, and `evidence_source`
  (a declared citeable origin for the fact, e.g. `"subagent-7"`; defaults to none).
- `workspace (str, "default")`, `repo (str, None)`, `session_id (str, None)`.
- `mtype (str, "semantic")`: default type for items without their own.
- `scope (str, None)`: same visibility rules as `engraphis_remember`.
- `source (str, "agent")`, `trusted (bool, true)`: one provenance for the whole batch.

The whole batch lands in one transaction (all-or-nothing); each fact is also resolved against
the siblings already resolved earlier in the batch, so duplicates reinforce and keyed claims
supersede within the batch. Afterwards, siblings that share a non-empty `subject_key` or the
same declared `evidence_source` get `related` graph edges labeled with that evidence: facts
with no declared evidence stay unwired ("no shared source, no edge"). Returns
`{workspace, repo, scope, stored:true, total, ops:[…], results:[{id, op}, …]}` with one entry
per input fact, in order.

### `engraphis_record_event`
Append one raw occurrence to the append-only event ledger. Event rows are not memories: they are
not recalled, deduplicated, reinforced, or consolidated as memories.

- `kind (str)`: stable event category, e.g. `decision`, `bug`, `fix`, `tried_and_failed`.
- `content (str)`: what happened.
- `workspace (str, "default")`, `repo (str, None)`, `session_id (str, None)`.

Returns `{id, kind}`. Choose this when each occurrence matters; use `remember` when the outcome
must itself be recalled, and promote a recurring pattern through `engraphis_consolidate`.

---

## Recall and read

### `engraphis_recall_context`  *(recommended for agent prompts)*
Return one hard-budget packed context plus compact source identities, without repeating full memory
bodies already represented in `context`.

- `query (str)`; `workspace (str, None)`; `repo (str, None)`; `session_id (str, None)`;
  `mtypes (list[str], None)`; `k (int, 50)`.
- `token_budget (int, 1024)`: hard packed-context budget, `0..32768`.
- `format (str, "full")`: `full` or compatibility alias `gist`; both return the same budgeted, cited evidence with complete conditions and code whitespace. `gist` adds a format marker without another summary or an extra savings claim.
- `retrieval_profile (str, "balanced")`: `balanced` is the default legacy hybrid; `auto` is
  explicit opt-in, with `fast`, `lexical`, `graph`, and `code` available for deliberate routing. The
  specialized graph/code profiles prioritize their named evidence while retaining supporting
  arms; diagnostics preserves both normalized and profile-adjusted scores.
- `fast` keeps vector and lexical recall while skipping graph traversal: an explicit
  small-vault profile. The full valid set is `balanced`, `auto`, `fast`, `lexical`, `graph`,
  `code` (`core/retrieval_policy.py`).
- `candidate_depth (str, "fixed")`: `fixed` preserves the historical 50-candidate pool;
  opt-in `adaptive` uses a deterministic profile-aware smaller pool for routine lexical/balanced
  queries while retaining wider graph/code pools. Responses report the requested and used depth.
- `packing_mode (str, "legacy")`: `legacy` preserves the established one-candidate-at-a-time
  packer; opt-in `coverage` reserves complete evidence units across sources before expanding them.
- `retrieval_recipe (str, "default")`: `default` preserves historical settings; opt-in
  `conversation` starts at `k=20` / 1,500 tokens and `long_session` at `k=10` / 4,096 tokens
  when the caller leaves depth and budget at their defaults. Explicit caller values win.
- `valid_at (float, None)`: what was true in world time; `known_at (float, None)`: what
  Engraphis had learned in system time; `as_of (float, None)` is the `valid_at` compatibility
  alias and must match when both are supplied.
- `diagnostics (bool, false)`: include the per-arm retrieval trace.
- `planning (str, "off")`: `off` preserves the single-query path; `auto` materializes the
  original query plus at most two planner routes, with strict per-route and cumulative bounds.
- `jev_assisted (bool, false)`: opt in to Jev prioritizing a route generated by the local
  deterministic planner. Requires `planning="auto"`; scope, time, type, and trust filters remain
  unchanged. Remote route selection requires explicit BYOK; managed `query_planning` fails closed
  before credential refresh or network requests and keeps deterministic order with a visible fallback.
- `allow_remote (bool, false)` and `data_classification (str, None)`: per-call consent for a Jev
  request; remote use requires `true` plus `public` or `internal`. The provider receives the query
  and bounded routes, not retrieved memory bodies. Uncertain or failed requests use deterministic
  route order. Keep both controls unset for local-only behavior.
- `mtype_limits (dict[str,int], None)`: optional post-rerank maxima by memory type. Limits drop
  lower-ranked results; they never boost relevance.
- `max_response_tokens (int, None)`: optional serialized-response cap `2..1000000`; truncation
  removes packed context from the end while preserving source references.

Returns `{query, count, context, sources, packed_sources, usage, valid_at, known_at, historical,
retrieval_profile, response_mode, receipt}`. `usage` always names `budget_tokens`,
`context_tokens`, `source_tokens`, `saved_tokens`, `savings_ratio`, `packed_count`,
`omitted_count`, and `token_counter`.

With no explicit workspace, a supplied authorized session provides its workspace/repo; otherwise
the supplied repo uses its saved mapping or `"default"`. Explicit mismatches with a session are
errors. Local calls without any workspace, repo, or session retain broad recall.

### `engraphis_recall`
Retrieve the memories most relevant to a query (hybrid vector + lexical + graph, fused + reranked).
It is the full-response compatibility surface; prefer `engraphis_recall_context` for a prompt.

- `query (str)`: natural language, e.g. `"how do we handle auth?"`.
- `workspace (str, None)`: restrict to this workspace.
- `repo (str, None)`: restrict to this repo; an omitted workspace uses its saved mapping or
  `"default"` when unmapped.
- `session_id (str, None)`: exact authorized session context; an omitted workspace/repo inherits
  from it. Includes repo/workspace ancestors while excluding every other session. Explicit
  mismatches and invalid/unauthorized sessions are errors, never fallback requests.
- `mtypes (list[str], None)`: restrict to these memory types.
- `k (int, 8)`: max results, `1..50`.
- `token_budget (int, None)`: hard packed-context budget; omitted uses the engine default.
- `retrieval_profile (str, "balanced")`: `balanced` default; `auto` only when explicitly set;
  `fast`, `lexical`, `graph`, and `code` are deliberate alternatives whose named arm is
  prioritized (`fast` keeps vector + lexical and skips graph traversal).
- `candidate_depth (str, "fixed")`: `fixed` preserves the historical candidate pool; opt-in
  `adaptive` is a deterministic profile-aware depth experiment. The response records the
  requested mode, actual depth, and reason.
- `packing_mode (str, "legacy")`: `legacy` preserves the established packer; opt-in `coverage`
  spreads complete evidence units across sources.
- `retrieval_recipe (str, "default")`: `default` preserves historical settings; opt-in
  `conversation` starts at `k=20` / 1,500 tokens and `long_session` at `k=10` / 4,096 tokens
  when depth and budget are left at their historical defaults.
- `response_mode (str, "full")`: `full` preserves legacy memory bodies; `compact` omits bodies
  already represented in `context`.
- `valid_at (float, None)`, `known_at (float, None)`; `as_of (float, None)` is the compatible
  `valid_at` alias and conflicts unless it matches `valid_at` exactly.
- `diagnostics (bool, false)`: include `retrieval_trace` with raw/normalized/fusion/rerank data.
- `planning (str, "off")`: `off` preserves single-query recall; `auto` enables bounded planning.
- `jev_assisted (bool, false)`: opt in to Jev prioritizing one alternate route from the local
  deterministic planner. Requires `planning="auto"` and explicit BYOK; Jev cannot change retrieval
  filters. Managed `query_planning` fails closed before credential refresh or network requests and
  keeps deterministic order with a visible fallback.
- `allow_remote (bool, false)` and `data_classification (str, None)`: per-call consent for a Jev
  request; remote use requires `true` plus `public` or `internal`. The provider receives the query
  and bounded routes, not recalled memories. Uncertain or failed requests keep deterministic order.
- `mtype_limits (dict[str,int], None)`: optional post-rerank maxima by memory type.
- `max_response_tokens (int, None)`: optional serialized-response cap `2..1000000`; truncation
  removes packed context and memory bodies from the end while preserving source references.

Returns `{query, count, context, memories:[{id, title, content, scope, mtype, repo_id, score,
arm, retention, provenance}], packed_sources, usage, valid_at, known_at, historical,
retrieval_profile, response_mode}`. `usage` contains the strict token fields listed above.
`count:0` with a `note` means that workspace/repo isn't known yet: not an error.
Successful calls append a privacy-safe operation receipt but do not reinforce weak neighbors just
because they were returned. Grounded recall reinforces cited evidence; explicit-use Python callers
can opt into reinforcement. The MCP tool remains stateful and non-idempotent because of its receipt.

### `engraphis_recall_grounded`
Answer a question **strictly from** stored memories, with `[n]` citations, or **abstain** when
nothing in scope supports it. Use when you want a grounded, non-hallucinated answer and would
rather get "insufficient evidence" than a guess. The default answer is deterministic and
extractive; optional LLM synthesis is accepted only when its claims remain cited.

- `query (str)`: the question, e.g. `"which auth scheme did we standardise on?"`.
- `workspace (str, None)`, `repo (str, None)`, `session_id (str, None)`,
  `mtypes (list[str], None)`, `k (int, 8)`.
- `valid_at (float, None)`, `known_at (float, None)`; `as_of (float, None)` remains the
  compatibility `valid_at` alias and must match if both are supplied.
- `token_budget (int, None)`; `retrieval_profile (str, "balanced")`; `candidate_depth (str,
  "fixed")`; `response_mode (str, "full" | "compact")`; `diagnostics (bool, false)`.
- `planning (str, "off")`; `mtype_limits (dict[str,int], None)`;
  `max_response_tokens (int, None)`: optional serialized-response cap `2..1000000`.
- `min_support (float, None)`: absolute support floor `0..1`; raise it to demand stronger
  evidence before answering.
- `synthesize (bool, false)`: ask a configured LLM for cited prose; falls back safely.

Returns `{query, grounded, abstained, answer, support, reason, synthesized, citations:[{n, id,
title, content, score, support, provenance}]}`. When `grounded` is false, `answer` is empty and
`reason` says why (insufficient evidence, or unknown workspace/repo).
Resolved calls append a privacy-safe receipt, including abstentions, and cited memories are
reinforced. This surface is stateful and non-idempotent.

### `engraphis_answer`
Backward-compatible grounded-answer alias with the same state effects. Prefer
`engraphis_recall_grounded` for new configs; keep using this only if an existing agent already
references it.

- `query (str)`; `workspace (str, "default")`; `repo (str, None)`; `k (int, 8)`;
  `min_support (float, 0.25)`; `synthesize (bool, false)`.
- `as_of (float, None)`: compatibility `valid_at` alias for a point-in-time answer;
  `valid_at (float, None)` is the world-time anchor; the two must match if both are
  supplied. `known_at (float, None)` anchors system time.
- `token_budget (int, None)`; `retrieval_profile (str, "balanced")`: `balanced`, `auto`,
  `fast`, `lexical`, `graph`, or `code`;
  `candidate_depth (str, "fixed")`; `response_mode (str, "full")`;
  `diagnostics (bool, false)`; `planning (str, "off")`;
  `mtype_limits (dict[str,int], None)`; `max_response_tokens (int, None)`.

### `engraphis_recall_proactive`
Conscious recall with **no query**: high-importance, recent, well-reinforced memories. Use at the
start of a task to load context before you know what to ask.

- `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `k (int, 10)`.

Returns `{memories:[…], last_session:{summary, open_threads, outcome}}`. When `repo` is given,
`last_session` is the authenticated caller's most recent *ended* session for that repo (or `{}`
if none); standalone trusted callers retain the unfiltered local handoff behavior.

### `engraphis_proactive_context`
Build a task-aware context packet from proactive recall, optional current agent state, and the
last-session handoff. Use at task start when an agent needs ready-to-use, cited context rather
than the raw queryless memory list.

- `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `task (str, "")`, `agent_state (str, "")`,
  `k (int, 10)`, `synthesize (bool, false)`, `token_budget (int, None)`,
  `response_mode (str, "full")`: use `compact` for one packed context packet.

Returns `{context_summary, suggested_memories, citations, suggested_queries, last_session,
grounded, synthesized, reason}`.
When `task` or `agent_state` is non-empty, its task-specific recall appends a privacy-safe receipt
without reinforcing memories, so the MCP tool is conservatively stateful and non-idempotent.


---

## History (bi-temporal)

### `engraphis_why`
Surface the current answer **and** what it superseded. Use for "why is it like this" / "what did
we used to do"; it looks past the live view into history, which plain recall does not.

- `query (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `k (int, 5)`.

Returns `{query, answer:[…live…], supersedes:[…what they replaced…]}`.

### `engraphis_timeline`
Every version of a fact in chronological order, including superseded ones.

- `query (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `limit (int, 20)`.

Returns `{query, history:[{…memory fields…, valid_from, valid_to}]}`, oldest first.

---

## Governance
All five preserve history (bi-temporal close, never a hard delete) and are audited. All verify
ownership against the `workspace`/`repo` you pass.

### `engraphis_correct`  *(preferred fix)*
Replace a memory's content without losing history: old content is closed, the correction is stored
as a new memory that records what it corrected, so the audit trail and `engraphis_why` still work.

- `memory_id (str)`, `new_content (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `reason (str, "")`.
- `exact_value (str, None)`, `exact_value_type (str, "literal")`,
  `exact_value_span ([start,end], None)`: explicitly bind a literal in the corrected content;
  integer character offsets select one occurrence when it is repeated.
- `clear_exact_value (bool, false)`: remove the binding; cannot be combined with a replacement.

Changed content clears the previous binding unless a replacement is supplied, even if the old
literal still occurs (for example, "BETA, not ALPHA"). Unchanged content preserves a valid binding
unless explicitly cleared. Neither operation changes the predecessor's content or binding.

Returns `{id, superseded:[old_id], reason}`. Prefer this over retire-then-remember.

### `engraphis_retire`
Retire a memory: it stops appearing in recall, history preserved.

- `memory_id (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `reason (str, "")`,
  `confirmed (bool, false)`: explicit local-operator confirmation, must be true; retirement
  closes history and every request is audited, including retries.

Returns `{id, status:"retired", reason}`. Use `correct` instead when you have replacement content.

### `engraphis_secure_erase`
Irreversibly remove one accidentally stored credential from local persistence. It deletes the
memory plus its local FTS/vector/ANN and derived graph/link rows, performs SQLite secure-delete,
WAL checkpoint, and VACUUM, and scans recognised local SQLite recovery backups. It cannot erase
exports, snapshots, remote peers, unknown backups, or content already read by an agent; rotate the
credential. This is destructive and intentionally does not preserve history.

- `memory_id (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`,
  `confirmed (bool, false)`: explicit local-operator confirmation, must be true; this
  irreversibly destroys the memory, its history, and local indexed derivatives. Rotate the
  credential first.

Returns `{id, status:"securely_erased", maintenance, recognised_backups_erased,
backup_limitations}`. The `vector_index_cleanup` result must be `deleted` before an injected
external vector backend can be considered remediated.

### `engraphis_forget` *(deprecated)*
Compatibility alias for `engraphis_retire`. It retains the old `status:"forgotten"` result for
existing clients, but new integrations must use `engraphis_retire`.

- `memory_id (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `reason (str, "")`,
  `confirmed (bool, false)`: explicit local-operator confirmation, must be true, as for
  `engraphis_retire`.

### `engraphis_promote`
Widen a live memory's visibility without editing it in place. The wider record is stored first;
the narrow source is then bi-temporally closed and linked, with provenance, pinning, sensitivity,
and learned stability inherited.

- `memory_id (str)`, `target_scope (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`,
  `reason (str, "")`.

`target_scope` must be strictly wider: session → repo/workspace or repo → workspace. User-scope
promotion is not yet supported because records remain workspace-bound. Returns
`{id, promoted_from, from_scope, scope, op, reason, receipt}`.

### `engraphis_pin`
Exempt a memory from automatic decay/pruning for durable conventions and identity facts.

- `memory_id (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `pinned (bool, True)`.

Returns `{id, pinned}`.

### `engraphis_link`
Explicitly connect two memories (A-MEM-style) when a plain recall wouldn't surface the relation.

- `a (str)`, `b (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `relation (str, "related")`:
  e.g. `caused_by`, `fixed_by`.
- `layer (str, None)`: `temporal` | `entity` | `causal` | `semantic`; omitted means infer
  from `relation`.
- `reason (str, "")`: optional rationale/context for why the relationship exists; persisted
  with the link and shown by inspection/graph APIs.

Returns `{a, b, relation, layer, reason, linked:true, receipt}`.

---

## Code

### `engraphis_index_repo`
Incrementally parse a repository into the code-symbol graph: modules/files, functions, classes,
methods, variables, docstrings/comments, definitions, calls, imports, inheritance, and
implementation edges. AST via tree-sitter when available, dependency-free regex fallback
otherwise. Existing memories that mention symbols are linked into the same traversal graph.

- `workspace (str)`, `repo (str)`, `root_path (str)`: local path to the repo root,
  `languages (list[str], None)`: omit to index every supported language found.

Returns `{files_indexed, files_unchanged, files_removed, symbols, edges, code_memory_links,
backend}`. Re-indexing hashes files, skips unchanged content, and removes deleted files only after
a complete scan. Reads local files at `root_path`; nothing is sent anywhere.

### `engraphis_search_code`
Find definitions by name, with their callers: structural search that costs far fewer tokens than
grepping or dumping files, and answers "what calls this / what breaks if I change it".

- `query (str)`: symbol or partial name, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str)` (must be indexed first),
  `limit (int, 20)`.
- `valid_at (float, None)`, `known_at (float, None)`; `as_of (float, None)` is the compatible
  `valid_at` alias and must match when both are supplied.

Returns `{query, symbols:[{name, fqname, kind, file, span, signature, docstring,
called_by:[…], linked_memories:[…]}]}` at the requested world/system-time point.

### `engraphis_code_path`
Find the shortest path across definitions, calls, imports, aliases, and code↔memory links.

- `source (str)`, `target (str)`: symbol, file, or memory id.
- `workspace (str)`, `repo (str)`, `max_depth (int, 8)`.
- `valid_at (float, None)`, `known_at (float, None)`; `as_of (float, None)` is the compatible
  `valid_at` alias.

Returns `{found, source, target, hops, path, edges}` with direction and provenance fields.

### `engraphis_code_impact`
Estimate commit/PR impact from repo-relative changed files.

- `changed_files (list[str])`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str)`.
- `valid_at (float, None)`, `known_at (float, None)`; `as_of (float, None)` is the compatible
  `valid_at` alias.

Returns risk score/level, touched symbols, inbound edges, dependent files, linked memories,
communities affected, hotspots, and potential conflict zones.

### `engraphis_export_code_graph`
Return portable `graph.json` data plus a human-readable Markdown report and self-contained HTML.

- `workspace (str)`, `repo (str)`.
- `valid_at (float, None)`, `known_at (float, None)`; `as_of (float, None)` is the compatible
  `valid_at` alias.

Returns `{graph, report_markdown, graph_html, valid_at, known_at, historical}`. Historical code
reads are pure reads and never reinforce memories.

### `engraphis_link_symbol`
Manually create a link between a code symbol and a memory. Use when automatic indexing misses a
relationship you know about -- for example, linking a deployment function to the incident memory it
resolved, or connecting a config constant to the decision that set its value. Idempotent: repeating
the same call returns the existing link without duplication.

- `symbol_id (str)`: symbol ID, short name, or fully-qualified name from an indexed repo.
- `memory_id (str)`: memory ID to link to the symbol.
- `workspace (str)`: workspace the repo belongs to.
- `repo (str)`: indexed repo containing the symbol.
- `relation (str, "mentions")`: relationship type (e.g. `mentions`, `implements`, `fixes`).
- `confidence (float, 1.0)`: link confidence `0..1`.
- `reason (str, "")`: optional reason or context for this link.

Returns `{link_id, symbol_id, memory_id, relation, workspace, repo}`.

---

## Sessions

### `engraphis_start_session`
Open a session to group this work's memories and enable cross-session resume.

- `workspace (str, None)`, `repo (str, None)`, `agent (str, "")` (e.g. `"claude-code"`),
  `goal (str, "")`, `force_new (bool, false)`,
  `resume_from_session_id (str, None)` for an explicit cross-agent handoff.

An explicit workspace wins; otherwise the saved mapping for `repo` is used, then `"default"`.
The result reports `workspace_source` as `explicit`, `project`, or `default`.

By default this is idempotent per exact `(workspace, repo, authenticated user, agent, goal)` task
identity. Different users, agents, or goals automatically open distinct sessions. An exact retry
returns the same active session with `reused:true`. Use `force_new=true` only to branch a second
session when every identity field matches. A new session returns `reused:false` plus
`{session_id, workspace, repo, goal, status:"active", bootstrap:{summary, open_threads, outcome}}`.
If a previous same-user/agent session in this repo ended with a summary/open threads, `bootstrap`
carries them so you resume without crossing an identity boundary. Pass `session_id` to `remember`
and `end_session`.

`resume_from_session_id` selects one exact ended session. It must belong to the same authenticated
user and exact resolved workspace/repo. Missing, active, deleted, or unauthorized sources fail
closed; the tool never substitutes a different or recent session. The returned bootstrap is bounded
to 512 regex-counted content tokens, at most six open threads, and per-field character limits.
`handoff_source` includes source start/end times in UTC. Sessions have no automatic age expiry, and
those timestamps do not guarantee freshness.

Authenticated host adapters must provide a stable non-empty user `id` and ownership `email` when
binding request context. Malformed non-`None` principals fail closed; only `None` selects trusted
standalone/system mode. Ownerless legacy sessions are not exposed to authenticated callers.

### `engraphis_end_session`
Close a session with a summary/outcome so the next one picks up the thread.

- `session_id (str)`, `summary (str, "")`, `outcome (str, "")` (e.g. `shipped`, `blocked`),
  `open_threads (list[str], None)`: surfaced for the next same-user/agent session in this repo.

Returns `{session_id, status:"summarized", summary, open_threads}`.

---

### `engraphis_ingest`
Store raw, undistilled text (transcripts, notes, logs). With `ENGRAPHIS_EXTRACTOR=llm`
configured server-side, the text is first distilled into discrete typed facts, each stored
with the same conflict resolution and evolution as `remember`. Without an extractor it
behaves exactly like `remember` (passthrough). Prefer `remember` when you already have one
crisp fact.

- `content (str, required)`; `workspace (str, required)`; `repo (str, None)`;
  `session_id (str, None)`; `mtype (str, "semantic")`: default type for unclassified facts;
  `scope (str, None)`: omitted defaults to repo for repo/session context, otherwise workspace.

Returns `{workspace, repo, count, extracted, facts: [{id, op, superseded?}]}`.

### `engraphis_ingest_postgres_schema`
Inspect a live PostgreSQL catalog into schema memories plus typed database/schema/table/column/
constraint graph nodes. The DSN is used for the connection only and is never stored or returned.

- `dsn (str)`, `workspace (str)`, `repo (str, None)`, `schemas (list[str], None)`.

### `engraphis_consolidate`
One sleep-time consolidation sweep: recurring episodic memories on the same subject become a
single durable semantic digest (linked to sources via `consolidates` links), and fully-decayed
transient memories are bi-temporally closed, audited, recoverable, and exempt when pinned.
`dry_run=true` is the pure default. Live deterministic retries skip already-consolidated
sources, but structured results may cite only part of a large cluster and let an identical later
call process the remainder, so the public tool is conservatively non-idempotent. Call it at
session end or on a schedule (`python -m scripts.consolidate` is the cron-able equivalent).

With `profiles=true` it also rolls every live memory mentioning an entity into one durable
semantic *profile* digest, a per-subject knowledge profile linked via `profiles` that grows with use.

- `workspace (str, required)`; `repo (str, None)`; `dry_run (bool, true)`;
  `profiles (bool, false)`; `structured (bool, false)`. `confirmed (bool, false)` must be
  true for a real (non-dry-run) sweep, which archives and distills governed state; dry runs
  need no confirmation.

Returns `{clusters_found, digests_created, archived, skipped_already_consolidated, compaction, dry_run}`.
The `compaction` field is the context tokens the sweep saved (before → after). With `profiles=true` a
`profiles` block is added (`entities_considered, profiles_created, skipped_existing, compaction`).

## Smart gateway

These nine tools are the default Smart MCP surface. The seven tools below expose session,
discovery, execution, inspection, update, and review operations that are not part of the classic
direct-tool inventory above. Discovery returns the exact capability schema; executors reject stale
or mismatched schemas and enforce the declared side-effect boundary.

The two overlapping names deliberately have smaller Smart schemas than their Classic sections
above. Smart `engraphis_remember` accepts only `content`, `workspace`, `repo`, `session_id`,
`mtype`, `importance`, `subject_key`, `claim_kind`, `exact_value`, and `exact_value_type`;
safe provenance is fixed internally. Exact values must occur uniquely and verbatim in
the supplied content; the service validates their type and preserves source offsets.
Smart `engraphis_recall_context` accepts only `query`, `workspace`, `repo`, `session_id`, `k`,
`token_budget`, `packing_mode`, `retrieval_recipe`, `format`, and optional Jev controls
`allow_remote` and `data_classification`; advanced planning/profile controls are discoverable rather
than routine. Setting `allow_remote=true` with a `public` or `internal` classification both opts in
to bounded route selection and grants consent for that call only. Defaults stay deterministic/local.
Remote route selection requires explicit BYOK. Managed and `auto` do not admit `query_planning`
or silently select BYOK; unsupported managed planning retains deterministic local order.

### `engraphis_session`
Start or resume a session, or end it with a next-session handoff.

- `action (str, "start")`: `start` or `end`.
- `workspace (str, None)`, `repo (str, None)`, `agent (str, "")`, `goal (str, "")`.
- `session_id (str, "")`: required when `action="end"`; on `action="start"`, optionally selects
  an exact ended cross-agent handoff from the same authenticated user and exact workspace/repo.
  An unavailable or mismatched source fails closed without fallback.
- `summary (str, "")`, `outcome (str, "")`, `open_threads (list[str], None)`: end-session handoff.
- `force_new (bool, false)`: start a new session instead of reusing an exact active task.
- `token_budget (int, 512)`: bounded goal context, `0..32768`.

Returns a bounded session/bootstrap or end-session handoff response. An explicit cross-agent
resume returns the selected source ID and UTC timestamps, with no automatic age expiry or freshness
guarantee. Starts use an explicit
workspace, then the saved repo mapping, then `"default"`, and report `workspace_source` with
the resolved `workspace` and `repo`. Keep using the returned `session_id` on remember and recall
calls; there is no server-global current session.

### `engraphis_discover_actions`
Return the exact schemas needed for a small set of matching advanced capabilities.

- `task (str)`: describe the needed capability without pasting memory content.
- `category (str, "")`: optional `memory`, `governance`, `code`, `audit`, or `ops` filter.
- `intent (str, "any")`: `any` | `read` | `write` | `admin` | `destructive`.
- `limit (int, 1)`: ranked actions to return, `1..3`.

Returns `{actions:[{capability_id, schema_digest, ...}]}` or an empty action list.

### `engraphis_execute_read`
Execute only a discovered action that is truthfully read-only and idempotent.

- `capability_id (str)`, `schema_digest (str)`: exact values returned by `discover_actions`.
- `arguments (dict)`: arguments matching the discovered schema.

Returns a bounded action result; stale, mismatched, or stateful capabilities are rejected.

### `engraphis_execute_action`
Execute a discovered write, administrative, or destructive-capable action safely.

- `capability_id (str)`, `schema_digest (str)`: exact values returned by `discover_actions`.
- `arguments (dict)`: arguments matching the discovered schema.

Returns a bounded action result with the canonical action identity and execution receipt when
applicable. Never invent capability IDs or arguments.

### `engraphis_get_memory`
Read one governed memory record without reinforcing it.

- `memory_id (str)`, `workspace (str, "default")`, `repo (str, None)`.

Returns the scoped record only when it is prompt-eligible; pending or quarantined content returns a
governance error rather than exposing untrusted text.

### `engraphis_update_memory`
Edit safe memory metadata fields while preserving the governed content-correction path.

- `memory_id (str)`, `workspace (str, "default")`, `repo (str, None)`.
- `title (str, None)`, `mtype (str, None)`, `importance (float, None)`: at least one is required;
  `mtype` is `working` | `episodic` | `semantic` | `procedural`, and `importance` is `0..1`.
- `actor (str, "user")`: audit actor label.

Content, provenance, trust, and sensitivity are not editable through this tool; use
`engraphis_correct` for content changes.

### `engraphis_conflict_review`
List pending, quarantined, or conflicting memories for a reviewer.

- `workspace (str, "default")`, `repo (str, None)`, `limit (int, 50)`: `1..100`.

Returns scoped review records without exposing pending/quarantined bodies to an agent.

## Ops

### `engraphis_list_workspaces`
List workspaces visible to the current caller so an agent can select a destination.

No parameters. Returns `{workspaces:[...]}` using the normal workspace-list records. This is
read-only and available through Smart discovery's read executor.

### `engraphis_get_workspace_routing`
Read the current caller's saved workspace destination for an exact repo name.

- `repo (str)`: stable project identifier supplied on the agent's MCP calls.

Returns `{repo, workspace, configured, source}`. A saved mapping returns `configured:true` and
`source:"project"`; an unmapped repo returns `workspace:null`, `configured:false`, and
`source:"default"`. This is read-only; it does not create the fallback workspace.

### `engraphis_set_workspace_routing`
Save or remove the current caller's repo-to-workspace association.

- `workspace (str)`, `repo (str)`, `enabled (bool, true)`.

Returns the same routing shape as `engraphis_get_workspace_routing`. Use `enabled:false` to
remove the association for that destination. The destination must be accessible. Mappings live
in the shared database and are scoped to the authenticated caller or standalone local context.
Explicit workspace arguments and supplied sessions retain precedence over the saved mapping.
Use Smart discovery and the action executor to change routing; this is not a read action.

### `engraphis_receipts`
List content-free, SHA-256-chained operation receipts for a workspace.

- `workspace (str)`, `limit (int, 100)`.

### `engraphis_context_savings`
Aggregate the content-free token-usage fields already stored in operation receipts. Results cover
all visible workspaces by default, or one workspace and optional repo, and are kept separate by
token-counter identity so unlike tokenizers are never added together. No prompt, answer, or
memory content is returned.

- `workspace (str, None)`; omit for all visible workspaces; `repo (str, None)`;
  `from_ts (float, None)` inclusive;
  `to_ts (float, None)` exclusive; `release_version (str, None)`;
  `format (str, None)`: `json` or `csv`; `group_by (str, None)`: `workspace`, `repo`, `agent`,
  or `day`.

Returns receipt coverage counts plus `by_token_counter` totals for source, context, saved, budget,
packed, and omitted tokens, with savings ratios, per-operation breakdowns, and receipt-chain
validity. Treat an invalid-chain aggregate as local diagnostics, not auditable evidence.

### `engraphis_verify_receipts`
Recompute hashes and validate chain order plus the independently stored local head/count anchor.
Optionally pass a previously exported `expected_head` / `expected_count` for verification against
an anchor kept outside the database. Returns `{valid, count, head, anchored, errors}`.

- `workspace (str)`; `expected_head (str, None)`; `expected_count (int, None)`.

### `engraphis_export_receipts`
Return the receipt-only export bundle plus verification result; raw memory/query contents and
actor/workspace names are excluded.

- `workspace (str)`.

### `engraphis_stats`
Memory counts (overall or for one workspace): handy for onboarding/health checks.

- `workspace (str, None)`.

Returns `{workspace, memories, total_rows, by_type, workspaces, sessions, schema_version,
prompt_eligibility, embedding}`. `memories` counts live rows; `total_rows` also includes
superseded history.

### `engraphis_check_update`
Report whether a newer Engraphis release is available, so an agent can proactively remind the
user to upgrade. Cached for 24 hours by default and fail-silent; `ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_CACHE`
accepts a TTL in seconds and falls back to 24 hours for invalid values. Update checks are
OFF unless `ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_CHECK` is set to an affirmative value; `=0` keeps them off. The
default GitHub source is overridable via
`ENGRAPHIS_UPDATE_URL`; the outbound client accepts HTTPS and rejects private/reserved destinations.

- `force (bool, false)`: bypass the 24-hour cache and re-check the release source now.

Returns `{enabled, current, latest, update_available, url, notice}`.

### `engraphis_decide`
Advisory command, contradiction, support, completion, or custom checks. The default backend
is local. Selecting `managed` uses the saved Engraphis Cloud session when configured;
`auto` selects only managed access, and `byok` explicitly selects a personal TypeSafe key.
Managed Jev is currently `not_yet_available` pending release acceptance and
service-capacity qualification; client configuration does not enable it. After
enablement, every legitimate Pro user and each eligible Team named seat, including paid
viewers, with an active paid, trial, or test entitlement receives managed Jev at no
additional customer charge and without a personal provider key.

Each individual receives all three independent rolling limits: **100 evaluated questions per rolling hour, 1,000 per rolling five hours, and 2,000 per rolling 24 hours**. Usage is per
person, not pooled across a Team and not monthly. Each evaluated question counts once;
if a batch is evaluated, every question counts. A `guard_command` review evaluates two
questions, and each other supported workflow evaluates one. Admitted attempts that fail
or are interrupted remain counted. No overage is charged. The account portal reports
that member's remaining usage across all three windows; usage returns as earlier
questions leave each rolling window.

The existing production fleet guard remains 100 questions per day across the service. It
conflicts with the per-person rolling caps and may pause or reject requests earlier, so
resolve capacity and the fleet guard before launch. No latency, accuracy, or cost-saving
guarantee is established by configuration or a successful health check. Smart discovery
uses `engraphis_execute_action` because a remote request may consume allowance.

Managed access admits only `guard_command`, `classify_contradiction`, `verify_support`, and
`verify_completion`, with the concrete context below and fixed question schemas. A purpose label
does not authorize arbitrary questions. Managed `custom` and `query_planning` fail closed before
credential refresh or network requests; custom remote questions and experimental route selection
require explicit BYOK. Neither managed nor `auto` silently switches to a personal provider key.
Paid Pro users and paid Team named seats, including viewers, receive the included managed
workflows after service enablement. Command review evaluates two questions; the other three
workflows evaluate one each. Admitted failures remain counted. Release acceptance, service
capacity, provider terms, and live quality evaluation remain gates; synthetic fixtures do not
demonstrate model accuracy.

Authorized viewers can use direct Classic advisory decisions without gaining memory writes or
administration. The generic Smart stateful executor still requires admin, and the private hosted
Team tool catalog is unchanged. The managed transport accepts an optional `request_key` for an
explicit retry: duplicate admitted keys return 409 without a second provider call or use increment.
There is no stored answer replay or automatic retry; the MCP tool does not expose this parameter.

- `kind (str, "guard_command")`: one of `'guard_command'`, `'classify_contradiction'`, `'verify_support'`, `'verify_completion'`, or `'custom'`.
- `state (str, "")`: nonblank shell command, candidate fact, or evidence text; required except when `custom` supplies `question`.
- `query (str, "")`: nonblank query required for support verification.
- `existing_content (str, "")`: nonblank existing memory required for contradiction checks.
- `goal (str, "")`: nonblank task goal required for completion verification.
- `recent_actions (str, "")`: optional summary of recent actions for completion verification.
- `question (str, "")`: custom question for `'custom'` decisions.
- `options (list[str], None)`: discrete choice alternatives.
- `offline_mode (bool, false)`: when true, forces deterministic local heuristics without external API calls.
- `allow_remote (bool, false)`: explicitly permits this call's supplied text to leave the device;
  backend selection alone never authorizes a request.
- `data_classification (str, "internal")`: remote input must be `public` or `internal`;
  secret classification and known secret patterns are rejected before credential refresh.

Every result includes `kind`, `backend`, `is_fallback`, `advisory_only`, `decision_status`,
`confidence`, and `confidence_source`. Remote results also include the pinned `model`.
The kind adds `allow_auto`/`escalate_to_user`/`safety_probability`/`category`, `verdict`,
`supported`/`probability`, `is_complete`/`completion_probability`, or `selected`/`probability`.
Missing required inputs return `invalid_request` before backend lookup with unknown/null
conclusions. `custom` accepts `state` or `question`; other kinds need `state` and their
required context above. Uncertain support/completion stays null. Fallback results include
`fallback_reason`, null confidence, and unmeasured heuristic labels. All command checks,
including successful remote answers, return `allow_auto=false` and `escalate_to_user=true`. Noul confidence is derived decisiveness, not measured calibration. Decisions do
not replace executable verification, authorization, or user approval. Local command labels are
coarse: only one simple inspection command, without chaining, pipes, substitution or file
redirection, is `read_only`; recognized destructive, history-rewriting, exfiltrating or
credential-file commands are `destructive_or_leak`; anything else is `state_change`.

## Quick decision guide

- Learned a durable fact → `remember`. Raw thing that happened → `record_event`.
- Need prompt context and have a question → `recall_context`. Need full legacy memory bodies →
  `recall`. Need raw context and don't yet → `recall_proactive`. Need a task-ready packet →
  `proactive_context`.
- "Why?" / "since when?" → `why` / `timeline`, not `recall`, which only sees the live view.
- Fact is wrong → `correct` (keeps the chain). Fact is obsolete with no replacement → `retire`.
- Fact applies more broadly than first believed → `promote` (widens without duplicate recall).
- Must never fade → `pin`. Two facts belong together → `link`.
- Working in code → `index_repo`, then `search_code`; use `code_path`/`code_impact` for structural
  questions and PR triage.
- Multi-step task → wrap in `start_session` … `end_session`.
- Have a blob, not a fact → `ingest`. Memory getting noisy → `consolidate` (dry-run first).
