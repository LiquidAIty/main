"""Client-side interpretation of Engraphis Cloud authorization denials.

The control plane returns structured JSON bodies on 401/402/403 with a
``reason`` field.  This module maps those reasons to user-facing messages
and UI actions (e.g. showing an upgrade prompt).  All actual authorization
decisions are made server-side; this module only translates the verdict for
the local dashboard's presentation layer.

Never trust these values for access control.  They are UX hints derived from
an authoritative server response that has already been validated by
``cloud_session`` and ``cloud_features``.
