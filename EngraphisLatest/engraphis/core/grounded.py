"""Grounded recall — answers, not just memories.

``recall`` returns ranked memories; ``grounded_recall`` turns those into an *answer*
that is strictly grounded in them, with inline ``[n]`` citations, plus an explicit
**abstain** when the retrieved evidence does not actually support the query. This is
what lets a product built on Engraphis promise "grounded, not guessed": the memory
layer refuses to answer rather than dressing up an irrelevant nearest-neighbour as
fact.

Two modes, one contract:

* **Deterministic (offline default).** No LLM. The answer is an *extractive* stitch of
  the cited memories — it never introduces a claim that is not in a source. The
  feature-hashing fallback is lexical-only: semantic cosine is disabled and the
  groundedness verdict uses lexical/predicate agreement. A declared semantic backend
  additionally contributes semantic cosine. Both are independent of the relative,
  per-query recall score, so "insufficient evidence" is a real threshold rather than
  a ranking artefact.
* **Synthesised (opt-in).** If an object implementing ``core.interfaces.LLM`` is
  injected, it may write prose — but constrained to the same numbered sources and the
  same abstain sentinel, and it degrades to the extractive answer on any error.

Security: retrieved memory content is UNTRUSTED — memory poisoning is an explicit
threat (SECURITY.md). The synthesiser fences sources as data and instructs the model
to ignore instructions found inside them; the deterministic path never executes source
text at all. Grounded answers additionally use only trusted, non-quarantined evidence,
so an untrusted source cannot be echoed into an extractive answer or an LLM prompt.
The abstain path means a poisoned-but-irrelevant memory cannot force an answer just by
being the nearest vector.
