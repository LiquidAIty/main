"""Cloud sync — convergent, offline-first replication of the memory store.

This is the *engine* half of the sync feature (the paid surface is gated at the
entry points — ``scripts/sync.py``, the MCP tool, the Inspector route — never in
here, so ``core/`` stays Apache-2.0 and license-free per AGENTS.md §3).

Why this is small: v2 already ships the hard primitives. Memory ids are globally
unique ULIDs (``core/ids.py``) minted with 80 bits of CSPRNG randomness, so two
offline devices never collide; ``Store.add_memory`` is an idempotent
``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE`` that only defaults timestamps when they are
null, so a remote write re-applies verbatim; and validity is bi-temporal, so a
"delete" is a ``valid_to`` we can merge rather than a destructive op. Sync is
therefore a **state-based CRDT** over memory rows, not a bespoke replication log:

* **Identity is global.** A memory's ULID is the same on every device; union by id.
* **Scope is per-device.** ``workspace_id``/``repo_id`` are per-device ULIDs, so we
  reconcile scope *by name* on apply (like ``scripts/migrate_to_v2.py`` re-homes
  rows) — memory identity stays stable, its scope pointers are re-homed locally.
* **Fields merge by a commutative lattice**, so the merged state is identical
  regardless of which device syncs first, and re-applying a bundle is a no-op:
    - ``valid_to`` / ``expired_at``: earliest non-null wins (an invalidation on any
      device invalidates everywhere — never resurrected).
    - ``stability`` / ``access_count`` / ``last_access``: ``max`` (reinforcement is
      monotone; the spacing effect only ever grows stability).
    - ``pinned``: a per-field pin lattice — ``pinned_at``/``unpinned_at`` markers
      merge latest-wins (the newest transition dominates), so a re-pin on one device
      beats a stale unpin on another instead of losing a legitimate toggle.
      ``pinned`` itself is derived from the merged markers.
    - ``deleted_at``: secure-erase tombstones are terminal within their known
      repository scope. An erased id is carried in the bundle's ``tombstones`` list
      (id + erasure time + origin device, never content) and merged earliest-wins;
      legacy repo-less markers remain global for compatibility, while a known marker
      cannot erase a same-id row from a sibling repository.
    - descriptive fields (title/content/keywords/…): last-writer-wins under the
      canonical ``modified_hlc``. Any initialized HLC beats the empty v1/v2 sentinel;
      legacy-only candidates retain bounded ``ingested_at`` plus a stable payload-hash
      tie-break. Recall's independent ``last_access`` max-join therefore cannot make an
      older edit win.
    - equal physical/logical HLC instants from concurrent devices still choose one
      deterministic winner by node id and payload hash, but the losing descriptive
      variant is retained once as a deterministic, explicitly untrusted conflict
      successor with a content-free audit trail. Replay cannot duplicate it.

Untrusted input: a pulled bundle is attacker-controlled (SECURITY.md — memory
poisoning is an explicit threat). ``apply_bundle`` validates and clamps every row,
re-homes it into the caller's own workspace, and never executes bundle content.
