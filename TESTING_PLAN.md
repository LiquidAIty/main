3. **Retention Policies**
   - Test data retention policies for different intervals
   - Verify old data is properly removed
   - Check impact on query performance

## 4. Integration Testing

1. **End-to-End Flow**
   - Test complete flow from data collection to visualization
   - Verify time series data appears in knowledge graph
   - Check forecast results update the visualization

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with large datasets (1M+ time points)
   - Verify visualization performance with 1000+ nodes
   - Check memory usage during long time range playback

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Test behavior when database connections fail
   - Verify graceful degradation when services are unavailable
   - Check retry mechanisms for transient errors

## 5. User Acceptance Testing

1. **Visualization Usability**

   - Verify smooth animations during time playback
   - Check loading times for initial data

## Test Data

For testing, we'll use the following datasets:

1. **Sample Knowledge Graph**
   - 100 entities of various types
   - 500 relationships between entities
   - Mix of temporal and non-temporal relationships

2. **Sample Time Series**
   - 10 time series with 1-minute data (last 7 days)
   - 20 time series with hourly data (last 30 days)
   - 5 time series with daily data (last 5 years)

3. **Forecast Test Cases**
   - Seasonal data with clear patterns
   - Trending data with growth/decline
   - Volatile data with irregular patterns
   - Data with missing values

## Test Environment

- Local Docker environment with Neo4j GDS and TimescaleDB
