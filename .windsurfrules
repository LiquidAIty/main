You are working in an Assist-first production codebase.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:

Never reconstruct or invent default prompts unless the DB field is empty.
If DB prompt exists, always use it verbatim.![alt text](image.png)

1) Assist mode is the shipped product.
   - Assist UX must be simple, stable, and non-admin.
   - No configuration UI, no debug controls, no orchestration visuals.

2) Agent Builder mode is INTERNAL ONLY.
   - It exists to tune Assist behavior.
   - It must never leak controls, selectors, or wiring into Assist mode.

3) DO NOT add UI elements, tabs, panels, settings, or controls unless explicitly requested.
   - No placeholders.
   - No “helpful” additions.
   - No admin affordances.

4) Chat must NEVER block on background work.
   - Knowledge ingest is fire-and-forget.
   - Failures log only.
   - Chat must always return a reply.

5) Knowledge is PROJECTION ONLY.
   - No ingest controls.
   - No schema editing.
   - No Cypher boxes in Assist.
   - No query result tables.
   - Visualization only.

6) Tabs are frozen:
   - Chat, Plan, Knowledge, Links, Dashboard
   - Do not rename, reorder, or add tabs.

7) No speculative refactors.
   - No renaming sprees.
   - No architectural rewrites unless explicitly approved.

8) Prefer minimal diffs.
   - Small, scoped changes.
   - Preserve working code.
   - Guard render paths defensively.

If a requirement is unclear:
- STOP.
- ASK for clarification.
- Do NOT guess.

Your job is to make the current product WORK, not redesign it.
